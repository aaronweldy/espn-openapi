# Project Memory

## Setup and Dependency Resolution

1. Created a `.gitignore` file with common Python exclusions
2. Created `README.md` for the project documentation
3. Configured `pyproject.toml` with:
   - Project metadata and configuration
   - Build system configuration (hatchling)
   - Package specification for models directory
   - Development dependencies

4. Required dependencies for the ESPN API client:
   - requests: HTTP client used for direct API requests
   - httpx: HTTP client used by generated OpenAPI client
   - pydantic: Used for data modeling/validation
   - typing-extensions: Extended type hints
   - attrs: Used by generated OpenAPI client for data models
   - python-dateutil: Used to parse ISO dates from API responses

## Project Structure

- The project uses generated OpenAPI clients based on the ESPN API schema
- Testing files are provided for different API endpoints
- `/models` directory contains the generated Python client
- `/json_output` stores raw and processed API responses

## Test Results

- Successfully tested team details API with Kansas City Chiefs (ID: 12)
- API response includes team data such as:
  - Team metadata (name, abbreviation, colors, logos)
  - Current record and standings
  - Venue information
  - Team links (roster, schedule, etc.)
