  - ðŸ“ˆ Improving (recent average better than season average)
  - ðŸ“‰ Declining (recent average worse than season average)

## Notes

- Games are processed in chronological order for accurate trend analysis
- Only completed games are included in statistics
- The `--last-n` parameter affects trend calculations and comparisons
- Division/conference records may not be available for all leagues
- Some historical data may be limited based on the ESPN API

## Rate Limiting

The recipe uses synchronous API calls with built-in error handling:
- Gracefully handles missing data or API errors
- No parallel processing to avoid rate limits
- Each team is processed sequentially
