      "description": "Mahomes agreed Wednesday with the Chiefs on a restructure of his contract, Adam Teicher of ESPN.com reports.",
      "story": "Mahomes and star defensive tackle Chris Jones both agreed to restructure their contracts Wednesday, freeing up a total of $49.4 million in cap space to help Kansas City maneuver in free agency. The team has already committed to a handful of key moves, including re-signing wideout Hollywood Brown to a one-year deal, placing the franchise tag on right guard Trey Smith and retaining linebacker Nick Bolton via a three-year contract. Mahomes remains signed through the 2031 season, and he'll enter the 2025 season with a reloaded supporting cast as the Chiefs work to bounce back from a disappointing 40-22 loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.",

      "story": "Mahomes was stifled for nearly three quarters in Super Bowl LIX before completing the first of three garbage-time touchdowns with 34 seconds remaining in the third quarter of Sunday's one-sided affair. The 28-year-old superstar saw his hopes of a potential third consecutive Super Bowl title erode away with each ensuing unsuccessful offensive drive against a ferocious unit led by defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Mahomes saw a decline in total production in 2024 despite earning the top seed in the AFC, but he maintained a respectable 26:11 TD:INT in 16 starts in the regular season. The Chiefs will look to regroup following a disappointing showing on the national stage and bring in more talent to surround Mahomes for the upcoming 2025 campaign.",
