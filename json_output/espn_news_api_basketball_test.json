Ishbia has owned the team for a little over two years and has already fired three coaches -- not exactly an inspiring track record for whomever replaces Budenholzer.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Suns are stuck in a multitude of ways. The team has traded control of its draft picks for the next several seasons and is well over the dreaded \"second apron\" of the NBA's salary cap, creating a wildly expensive roster with few tools to improve it. There's a chance Durant is traded this summer, after Phoenix flirted with the idea at the trade deadline, but it remains to be seen how much value the 36-year-old future Hall of Famer will have as he enters the final year of his contract. Durant will be looking for an extension at more than $60 million per season.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p><strong>Who could get the job?</strong></p>\n<p>After weeks of interviews, ESPN's Sham Charania reported Monday that the Suns' search for their next <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45435950/sources-cavaliers-bryant-ott-finalists-suns-coaching-job\">head coach is down to two candidates</a>, both from the Cleveland Cavaliers: associate coach Johnnie Bryant and assistant Jordan Ott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bryant has served as an assistant with the Utah Jazz (2012-20) and New York Knicks (2020-24), while Ott has worked for the Atlanta Hawks (2013-16), Brooklyn Nets (2016-22) and Los Angeles Lakers (2022-24).</p>\n<p>After firing Budenholzer on April 14, new GM Brian Gregory has led a multiround hiring process that began with more than 15 candidates, sources told Charania. A group of five finalists -- including Bryant, Ott, Miami assistant Chris Quinn, Oklahoma City assistant Dave Bliss and Suns assistant David Fizdale -- had in-person interviews with team officials last week.</p>\n<p><em>-- Tim Bontemps</em></p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Hired jobs</h2>\n<h2><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/den.png?w=110&h=110\" width=\"30\">Denver Nuggets</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2024-25 record:</strong> 50-32 (No. 4 in West)</li>\n<li><strong>Previous coach: </strong>Michael Malone (fired April 8; assistant David Adelman took over on interim basis)</li>\n<li><strong>Lead executive:</strong>\u00a0None (GM Calvin Booth, promoted in 2020, was also let go)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Positive: Championship-level talent</strong></p>\n<p>These kinds of jobs rarely come available.\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"22f57511-06ae-1587-f01b-33965365ce0d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3112335/nikola-jokic\">Nikola Jokic</a> might lose out to <a data-player-guid=\"4dcec409-3ff9-2881-2bc3-b4289ce6c36d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander\">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a>\u00a0for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/44492655/nba-mvp-straw-poll-100-insiders-rank-sga-jokic-lebron-more\">this season's Most Valuable Player award</a>, but he's nearly universally seen as the best player on the planet.\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"153b92a9-8489-74e3-c524-6527eb991e84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936299/jamal-murray\">Jamal Murray</a> is an elite pick-and-roll partner and,\u00a0after struggling in the playoffs, is back to playing at a high level -- over the summer with Team Canada and at the start of this season. <a data-player-guid=\"d6c22a9f-fbe3-1566-e175-c86137d057a5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064290/aaron-gordon\">Aaron Gordon</a> is a versatile defender who fits perfectly next to Jokic at both ends, and <a data-player-guid=\"44c766da-e62b-549a-0575-18b1efc537a1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4431767/christian-braun\">Christian Braun</a>\u00a0has come on and had a terrific season, putting him into Most Improved Player consideration.</p>\n<p>While the Western Conference is deep with contenders, Denver still arguably was set to enter the playoffs as a favorite behind\u00a0<a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bd458c44-2d33-47eb-cebc-35d3d4ac595c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder\">Oklahoma City</a>\u00a0before Tuesday's shocking news of Malone's dismissal after 10 years and unparalleled success with the Nuggets. Whoever walks into this job will believe they can win a championship immediately.</p>\n<p><video3></p>\n<p><strong>Negatives: Limited financial and roster flexibility</strong></p>\n<p>Denver has never been known to open the checkbook to pay for coaches and executives, but that's a secondary concern to the long-term constraints on trying to keep this team at a championship level. Like most longtime championship contenders, this is a franchise that has traded away a lot of draft picks and is locked in on long-term contracts. The good part about that is the team's core players are all under contract for at least a couple more years. The bad? The roster has few means to improve and might not be good enough to get where Denver wants to go now.</p>\n<p><strong>Who got the job:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>After serving as the interim coach since Michael Malone was let go last month, David Adelman, son of Hall of Fame coach Rick Adelman, was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45272261/sources-nuggets-make-david-adelman-new-head-coach\">promoted to head coach Thursday</a>.

The Spurs have drafted the Rookie of the Year in back-to-back years with potential superstar <a data-player-guid=\"0e8844b2-d923-3926-82d2-f19a29d69490\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama\">Victor Wembanyama</a> and guard <a data-player-guid=\"26c7892b-12d0-3b1d-9645-f881921a1a20\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4845367/stephon-castle\">Stephon Castle</a>. They have two lottery picks in this year's draft, both theirs and the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"15096a54-f015-c987-5ec8-55afedf6272f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks</a>, combined giving them about a 30% chance of getting a top-four pick. They own all their future draft picks, both first and second round, going forward and beyond this year have two additional first-rounders, nine additional second rounders, and first-round pick swaps with the Hawks in 2027, the Mavericks or Wolves in 2030 and the Celtics in 2021. The Spurs also traded for a franchise point guard, <a data-player-guid=\"5f18d1cf-1c2e-3601-a04e-1a3fc84d8ef1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066259/deaaron-fox\">De'Aaron Fox</a>, who is in position to sign a long-term contract extension later this year.</p>\n\n\n<p><video5></p>\n<p><strong>Negatives: Market size, ownership spending power, big shoes</strong></p>\n<p>Though San Antonio is a growing city, it still is one of the league's smaller markets and has various effects on acquiring players, though the Spurs' organization enjoys an excellent reputation. The ownership has paid just $5 million in luxury tax in the past 13 years and with big contracts coming for Fox and Wembanyama plus the new challenges that come with high payrolls, spending is something to monitor. That said, since the Spurs were last contenders they have taken on new deep-pocketed partners, including billionaire computer magnate Michael Dell and investment firm Sixth Street. There is also the challenge of coming behind Popovich, someone who won five championships and established a massive legacy over the previous 29 years.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Who got the job:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Johnson, who was named acting coach after Popovich suffered a mild stroke in November, now takes over head coaching duties on a permanent basis. Popovich had leaned on Johnson over the past several years, giving him increasing responsibility both in terms of preparation and in-game. Johnson has developed a strong relationship with Wembanyama already as well.\u00a0Johnson led San Antonio to a 31-45 record in Popovich's absence.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><em>-- Brian Windhorst</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/mem.png?w=110&h=110\" width=\"30\"><b>Memphis Grizzlies</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2024-25 record:</strong> 48-34 (No. 8 in West)</li>\n<li><strong>New coach:</strong>\u00a0Tuomas Iisalo (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/44969973/grizzlies-hire-tuomas-iisalo-coach-interim-stint\">hired on May 2</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Previous coach: </strong>Taylor Jenkins (fired March 28; Iisalo took over on interim basis)</li>\n<li><strong>Lead executive:</strong> Zach Kleiman (hired in 2019)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Positive: A promising young core</strong></p>\n<p>Despite suffering injuries throughout the season, the Grizzlies are still in the top five in the Western Conference standings, and with the league's fifth-best net rating -- trailing only the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bd458c44-2d33-47eb-cebc-35d3d4ac595c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder\">Oklahoma City Thunder</a>, Cleveland Cavaliers, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2ca761df-5f60-b2e9-22ed-e099c46d889b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics\">Boston Celtics</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"78113ad4-1ac7-0c04-dada-388a6ff4e15e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a>.</p>\n<p>With\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"de5f87e0-8571-a730-ade4-6d00d10b8577\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4279888/ja-morant\">Ja Morant</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"10c8715d-6e1c-40de-59cb-625bf16ebbc7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066320/desmond-bane\">Desmond Bane</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"dbe0e9e5-0046-c414-000b-f4e629b08f5d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277961/jaren-jackson-jr\">Jaren Jackson Jr</a>., Memphis' core is entering its prime, which should give the Grizzlies runway to contend for the rest of this decade.

That's the kind of boost Kleiman and the Grizzlies believe is possible.</p>\n<p><video4></p>\n<p><strong>Negatives: Small market, recent instability</strong></p>\n<p>Memphis is far from an NBA glamour market, and this team has had a lot of friction and uncertainty over the past year.</p>\n<p>The Grizzlies fired virtually Jenkins' entire coaching staff last summer, bringing in -- among others -- Iisalo and Noah LaRoche to fill it out. Then, not only was Jenkins dismissed Friday, but so was LaRoche, who hired several player development coaches.</p>\n<p>Now, on to the roster. In addition to numerous injuries, the Grizzlies have had a series of off-court issues with Morant over the years. The team had mitigated Morant's absence thanks to its other two stars, Jackson and Bane, its impressive depth and, until he was fired, Jenkins' work on the sidelines.</p>\n<p><strong>Who got the job:\u00a0Tuomas Iisalo</strong></p>\n<p>The expectation around the league was that Iisalo would get a long look for the job after the franchise moved on from Jenkins in late March.

Sacramento has made the playoffs in three of the 33 seasons not coached by Adelman, underscoring the difficulty of this job.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/44717595/sources-kings-finalizing-deal-hire-scott-perry-gm\" target=\"_blank\">Longtime NBA executive Scott Perry Perry now replaces McNair</a>, who parted ways with the Kings following their elimination in the play-in tournament. The team had also seen the departure of assistant general manager Wes Wilcox, who took the GM job for the Utah Utes earlier this month. Another drawback is the club's unwillingness to pay into the luxury tax, something owner Vivek Ranadive has avoided.</p>\n<p><strong>Who got the job:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/44918568/sources-kings-name-doug-christie-full-head-coach\">Christie is finalizing a multiyear contract</a> to become the franchise's next coach, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania on Tuesday. Christie has long-standing ties to the organization, going back to being a starter on those iconic teams of the early 2000s under Adelman, and he had done a solid job the past few months since taking over for Brown.\u00a0Sacramento went 27-24 this season under Christie, ranking ninth in offensive efficiency during that span and going 13-10 in clutch-time games compared to 6-13 earlier in the campaign under Brown, according to ESPN Research.</p>\n<p><em>-- Bontemps</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n"
