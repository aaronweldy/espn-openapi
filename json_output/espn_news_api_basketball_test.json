Aari McDonald, making her Indiana debut, made the Fever\u2019s fifth 3-pointer of the third with 2:29 left.\n\n\r\n              Washington scored the opening 12 points of the fourth quarter to get within 69-67 on layup by Brittney Sykes.\n\n\r\n              But Indiana scored seven straight points to pull away. Hull made an open layup for a 78-73 lead and she helped force a jump ball at the other end. The Fever won the jump ball and Mitchell completed a three-point play, after a reverse layup, for an eight-point lead at 1:28.\n\n\r\n              Aliyah Boston added 10 points for Indiana (3-4). \n\n\r\n              Kiki Iriafen and Sykes each scored 20 points for Washington (3-5). Sonia Citron, second among rookies at 14.3 points per game, added 13 points and Shakira Austin had 10. \n\n\r\n              The Fever made a season-high 11 3-pointers, while the Mystics were just 1 of 10 from long range.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP WNBA: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball\">https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball</a>\n\n\r\n"

Sloan's best chance at winning a title came a decade into his time as head coach with the franchise -- the Jazz won 64 and 62 regular-season games in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 seasons, and made the Finals both years. But they ran into Michael Jordan's second three-peat with the Bulls.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>George Karl</h2>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season wins: 1,175 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season winning percentage: .588</strong></p>\n<p>Karl's well-traveled NBA coaching career had stops with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a>, Seattle SuperSonics, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f59bbabc-eedb-9ad2-c5dd-9bcd9f450a2f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks\">Milwaukee Bucks</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c4aceb39-0eb9-a30b-1120-9cb5b12b677a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e266c4ea-9af3-1bd8-06fb-fd608fd30e26\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings\">Sacramento Kings</a>, spending a total of 27 seasons as head coach.</p>\n<p>The veteran coach's closest brush with Finals glory came in 1995-96 with the SuperSonics -- which was also thwarted by Jordan and the Bulls, coming in the first year of the team's second 1990s three-peat.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rick Adelman</h2>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season wins: 1,042 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season winning percentage: .582</strong></p>\n<p>Starting with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, Adelman's lengthy head coaching career included stints with the Trail Blazers, Warriors, Kings, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"78113ad4-1ac7-0c04-dada-388a6ff4e15e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"13f727cb-254d-b484-a337-93fcc0047add\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a>.</p>\n<p>Adelman's best shots at a ring came early in his journey as a coach. He guided Portland to the Finals in 1990 in his first full season as head coach but fell to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4e096981-dc02-51d0-3dcd-2468fcc1e22d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons\">Detroit Pistons</a> in five games. Two seasons later, the Trail Blazers again won the Western Conference, but were felled by -- you guessed it -- Jordan and the Bulls in the Finals.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stan Van Gundy</h2>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season wins: 554 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season winning percentage: .566</strong></p>\n<p>After getting his start in the NBA as an assistant to Pat Riley with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"81e3212c-30ef-9b1b-5edb-453b13ff265a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a>, Van Gundy broke into the head coaching ranks after replacing Riley (who stayed in his role as team president) atop Miami's staff ahead of the 2003-04 season.</p>\n<p>It would be at Van Gundy's ensuing stop, though, with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74c23102-8c27-c8e6-ec1b-8a8fd4d42554\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic</a>, where he'd come closest to winning his first NBA championship.

They then faced off against Kobe Bryant and the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> in the NBA Finals, with the Lakers prevailing in five games.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mike D'Antoni</h2>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season wins: 672 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season winning percentage: .560</strong></p>\n<p>D'Antoni put together highly successful stretches with multiple franchises -- he eclipsed 50 regular-season wins four straight seasons with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6eade89-5971-0e84-8ccb-cd91482b2b50\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a> and three straight seasons with the Rockets -- but never advanced to the Finals.</p>\n<p>Though D'Antoni made the Western Conference finals twice with the Suns, his most brutal near-miss for championship glory probably came during his time in Houston. In 2017-18, the Rockets, led by then-league MVP <a data-player-guid=\"35b0f455-b1df-0986-121d-27d2b6c18122\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a>, took a dynastic Warriors squad to seven games in the conference finals. But a <a href=\"https://x.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1257471473813504000\">historic cold stretch</a> at the worst time helped Golden State advance, going on to sweep the Cavaliers in that season's Finals.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scott Brooks</h2>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season wins: 521 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season winning percentage: .557</strong></p>\n<p>Best known as the head coach of the <a data-player-guid=\"e849e50f-b1b7-4256-1de2-ca49862e218d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook\">Russell Westbrook</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>-led <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bd458c44-2d33-47eb-cebc-35d3d4ac595c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder\">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> squads of the early-to-mid 2010s, Brooks displayed impressive consistency across his time with the franchise, leading the Thunder to 45-plus regular-season wins in each of his last six seasons.</p>\n<p>The 2011-12 season marked his closest brush with the Larry O'Brien Trophy, when he led a young Thunder squad to the team's first Finals in Oklahoma City. In that Finals, the Thunder faced off against the Heat and their big three of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, with Miami prevailing in five games.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don Nelson</h2>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season wins: 1,335\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Career regular-season winning percentage: .557 </strong></p>\n<p>Boasting a staggering 1,335 regular season wins -- second most of any head coach in league history -- Nelson accomplished plenty in a coaching career that started in the 1970s and ended in 2009-10. But remarkably the veteran boss never made a Finals appearance over his 31 seasons atop coaching staffs with Milwaukee, two stints with Golden State and the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f00d1f4e-4ce6-d581-466c-5b52531cf7ad\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks</a>.</p>\n<p>Nelson's best shot at a ring was at the tail end of his tenure with the Bucks, when he led them to a stretch of three conference finals appearances in four years. In each of those years, Milwaukee lost to the eventual Finals winner.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"
