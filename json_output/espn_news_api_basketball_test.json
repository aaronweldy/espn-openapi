Hawaii has been a football-only member of the Mountain West since 2012. UC Davis has been a football-only member of the Big Sky Conference.</p>\n<p>Utah Valley is leaving the Western Athletic Conference, and the Wolverines will compete in 13 Big West-sponsored sports, including men's and women's basketball, baseball and softball.</p>\n<p>\"Their addition expands our geographic footprint into a vibrant and strategically significant region, while elevating the level of competition across the board,\" Big West Commissioner Dan Butterly said.</p>\n<p>Utah Valley will be the largest school in the Big West with an enrollment of 47,000. Barring further realignment, Utah Valley will replace Hawaii as the only school in the conference outside California.</p>\n\n\n\n"
