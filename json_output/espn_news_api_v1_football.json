After a presumed two years of being together, the pair tied the knot on May 31, 2025, after a six-month engagement.<br>\n<br>\n<alsosee></p>\n<p>Allen, the reigning NFL MVP and Art Rooney Award recipient, is a star on the field. Steinfeld is one in front of a camera and in the recording studio. The BAFTA and Academy Award-nominated actress has starred in the hit films \"Pitch Perfect 2,\" \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse<em>\"</em>\u00A0and, most recently, \"Sinners.\" She's also known for her hit singles \"Starving\" and \"Love Myself,\" which appeared on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<p>From their big day to the hard launch to the first spotting together, here is how their relationship evolved.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<h2>May 31, 2025: Wedding day</h2>\n\n\n<p>The big day came. Allen and Steinfeld <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45413681/josh-allen-hailee-steinfeld-wedding-buffalo-bills\">tied the knot</a> at an exclusive resort in Ventura, California, according to multiple reports. Allen wore a black tuxedo while Steinfeld wore a stylish white dress.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>April 2025: Steinfeld's plus-one</h2>\n\n\n<p>Allen accompanied Steinfeld on April 5 to the afterparty of the New York premiere of her latest film, \"Sinners.\" Steinfeld's character, Mary, has a lead role alongside actor Michael B. Jordan, who plays both Smoke and Stack. Allen did not join her on the red carpet, but was spotted with her as the two left the afterparty.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>\"I'm so proud of her. [\"Sinners\" is]<em>\u00A0</em>getting some great reviews. It's a fantastic movie, so go watch it,\" Allen said at an April 22 news conference.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Feb. 6, 2025: Night out in New Orleans</h2>\n\n\n<p>Steinfeld and Allen made their long-awaited red carpet debut as a couple at the NFL Honors in New Orleans, where Allen was named the 2024 NFL MVP.</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>Allen thanked her in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTLYcvEIm-I\">his acceptance speech</a>, saying: \"My fianc\u00E9e, Hailee, you've been my rock, you're my best friend. I would not be standing on this stage if it weren't for you.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Nov. 29, 2024: The engagement</h2>\n\n\n<p>Steinfeld and Allen got engaged on Nov. 22 in Malibu, California, but waited until Nov. 29 to announce it in a joint Instagram post.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Steinfeld opened up about the engagement in a February interview with <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion/cover-features/hailee-steinfeld\">Who What Wear</a>. She said she didn't have an inkling that he'd be proposing that night.</p>\n<p>\"I'm so grateful that he did it the way he did so that I looked good, and we have these photos that we'll have and cherish for the rest of our lives that I'm not looking at being like, 'What was I wearing?'\" she said.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Oct. 31, 2024: The hard launch</h2>\n\n\n<p>Steinfeld went Instagram-official, showing her and Allen hosting their \"circus showdown\" party in matching ringleader Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>July 23, 2024: The soft launch\u00A0</h2>\n\n\n<p>Allen and Steinfeld went Instagram-official in a photo dump posted by Allen. He posted a picture that appears to be of the two in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris and then another with Steinfeld in a group photo.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Early 2024: From Paris (and the Golden Globes) with love</h2>\n\n\n<p>At the Golden Globes, which took place Jan. 7, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Kl0c_Qze6dA\">a reporter held up</a> a Stefon Diggs Bills jersey toward Steinfeld as she walked through a crowd and asked her how she felt about the Bills' regular-season finale\u00A0<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547647/bills-dolphins\">against the </a><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"af33088b-1e19-d27d-dbc0-354fd7151703\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a>. From a distance, Steinfeld replied, \"Real good,\" but before walking away she yelled out, \"Wrong number though!\"</p>\n<p>In early March, the two were <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4LznENODzO/\">seen together leaving dinner</a> in Paris -- with some speculation that Allen's <a href=\"https://x.com/JoshAllenQB/status/1765143521307009522\">viral tweet</a>\u00A0about him ripping his pants in the French capital might have been referencing a dinner with Steinfeld.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Fall 2023: Across the pond and shopping with mom</h2>\n<p>Steinfeld began making herself comfortable in and around Buffalo. She joined Allen's mother on a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx1JZ4uSEw5/\">shopping trip</a> to Level Up Buffalo, and the local boutique shared a picture of them at the store on Sept. 30.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 8, Allen's friend and race car driver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/racing/driver/_/id/4510/daniel-ricciardo\">Daniel Ricciardo</a> was spotlighted in an X post at the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547228/jaguars-bills\">Bills' London game</a> against the\u00A0<a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ca6fb778-cbf6-d9a3-3e93-01230335fcab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. The caption hinted at a certain musician/actress sitting beside him who didn't get a shoutout on the jumbotron.</p>\n<p>There have been a few Steinfeld sightings at Bills games since their relationship began, but she has preferred to keep a low profile.</p>\n<p><inline5></p>\n<p>Allen and Steinfeld were rumored to have <a href=\"https://x.com/sweetannieod/status/1712620103534309709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1712620103534309709%7Ctwgr%5E086ef3d0f3eb99e480428377e2f7b934503fea34%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwyrk.com%2Fhailee-steinfeld-buffalo-sabres%2F\">made an appearance</a> at the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"06b99a18-3096-3b1f-d339-adab9ac51614\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-sabres\">Buffalo Sabres</a> home game against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4e807ac9-f3b7-8e3b-8549-441c1e604c17\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/nyr/new-york-rangers\">New York Rangers</a> on Oct. 12.

What a time to be alive.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>May 2023: The first sighting</h2>\n\n\n<p>The first Steinfeld and Allen sighting happened in late May 2023. They were\u00A0<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cst6eF1On3z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">spotted together</a> after a night out in New York City on May 25.</p>\n<p>A source close to Steinfeld
