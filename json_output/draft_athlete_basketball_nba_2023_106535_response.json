      "text": "<p><strong>Nov. 7, 2022</strong> <br><br>Wembanyamania hit its peak with a pair of exhilarating October performances against the Ignite. The 7-foot-4 super prospect posted 73 points in 70 minutes with a breathtaking display of shot-making, ballhandling, shot-blocking and passing unlike anything we've ever seen before. <br><br>Wembanyama hasn't missed a beat since returning to France. He is producing steadily, as his Metropolitans 92 team has won four straight games (6-1 overall) and is second in the LNB Pro A, proving his extraordinary talent translates to winning, something that is rare for an 18-year-old at this level of competition. Wembanyama isn't only leading his team, he is emerging as the most productive player in the entire league, ranking second in scoring, third in rebounding, first in blocks and fifth in usage rate. <br><br>Unsurprisingly, Wembanyama is playing a different style of basketball in France than what scouts saw against the Ignite in Las Vegas, something his coach, Vincent Collet, said is expected considering the shorter 3-point line and increased physicality of the European game. <br><br>\"Defense is different [in the United States],\" Collet said. \"He has more room in the G League game. And probably the referees are protecting more. Sometimes they grab him in France [making a bear hug motion with arms]. So that's something special that didn't happen [in Las Vegas]. I don't think he has to play to make seven 3s each game.\" <br><br>Towering over opponents, we've seen Wembanyama look more assertive, utilizing his size and physicality operating with his back to the basket, where he shows an extremely high skill level and is big enough to simply shoot over virtually any defender with unstoppable turnaround jumpers. While Wembanyama's perimeter shooting, fluidity pushing off the defensive glass and handling in pick-and-roll and isolation situations generate some of his most notable highlights, the footwork, fluidity, dexterity and touch he shows in the post also is encouraging considering his propensity to shy away from contact in the past. <br><br>Wembanyama still drops glimpses of the same incredible talent he displayed in Las Vegas, having the freedom to push the ball the length of the floor, reject ball screens or shoot coming off pindowns or one-legged jumpers -- things that are unheard of and simply mesmerizing for a player his size. He hasn't been quite as consistent with his outside shot -- 11-for-33 from 3 in France as compared to 9-for-18 against the Ignite -- but part of that is due to difficult attempts, the amount of defensive attention he draws every game and some regression to the mean after a scorching 7 for 11 performance in one of the Ignite games in Vegas. <br><br>Defensively, Wembanyama is similarly a game-changer, anchoring the French league's stingiest defense (101.4 points per 100 possessions). Though his presence alone deters opposing teams from challenging him in the paint, he still leads the league in blocks. <br><br>His 8-foot wingspan not only protects the rim, it allows him to recover when he is beat off the perimeter. He is intelligent defending ball screens, exhibits impressive poise and patience staying on his feet and avoids silly fouls, showing great hands swiping down for deflections and steals, which is part of the reason his team leads the league in turnovers generated. <br><br>The one area scouts want to see him improve is with his physicality on the defensive glass, where he still gets pushed around. Still, it's difficult not to be impressed by how much he has upgraded his intensity level from years past. <br><br>Next for Wembanyama will be a fascinating change of jerseys as he receives a call-up to represent the French national team for the first time at the senior level in a pair of FIBA World Cup qualifying games. France will play a challenging road game in Lithuania on Nov. 11, one of the top teams in Europe, followed by a home game on Nov. 14 against Bosnia and Herzegovina. These matchups will offer scouts yet another opportunity to see Wembanyama play in a new and different setting, something that should only add to the significant experience he already is garnering prior to being the inevitable No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA draft. <em>-- Jonathan Givony</em></p> <p><strong>Oct. 10, 2022</strong> <br><br>We've been scouting Wembanyama at ESPN since he was 14 years old. But even though former ESPN employee Mike Schmitz called him \"the best prospect in Europe\" in February 2020 and \"the world's most intriguing NBA prospect\" 18 months ago, it's still astonishing to see the progress the projected No. 1 pick from France has continued to make. <br><br>While Wembanyama, now 18, has always showcased unique versatility, shot-blocking instincts, coordination, feel for the game and perimeter skill, he wasn't always this ultraconfident, aggressive big man who looks to take a team on his shoulders like he did last week. Early in his career, he struggled to play through contact and maintain his intensity for longer stretches, even being deemed soft by some onlookers because of his tendency to float, settle for jumpers and have lapses defensively. While he still has stretches where he gets outmuscled and pushed around on the defensive glass, and he is still very much filling out his lanky frame, Wembanyama's mentality has improved considerably with his consistent engagement and willingness to put his imprint on games. <br><br> After making seven 3s and only four rebounds in his first contest in Las Vegas, he showed different facets by unleashing a devastating post arsenal in the second one, dishing four assists and a game-high 11 rebounds -- many of which came from out of his area, and in traffic, while he showed real physicality and grit. <em>-- Jonathan Givony</em></p> <p><strong>June 24, 2022</strong> <br><br>Victor Wembanyama is a player we've all been penciling in at No. 1 for the better part of three years, and for good reason. He stands 7-foot-3 with a 7-9 wingspan, has an exceptionally high skill level and feel for the game, and possesses defensive player of the year-type instincts as a shot-blocker. <br><br>Wembanyama could very well be on the move this offseason thanks to an opt-out clause in his contract that he's expected to execute at the conclusion of the French playoff finals. Reports in France indicate there's a level of unhappiness brewing regarding the way several minor injuries he suffered this season were diagnosed and treated, while the head coach of his current ASVEL team -- owner Tony Parker's brother, T.J. -- hasn't left a lasting impression thus far. G League Ignite and Paris Basket are said to be the main candidates for his signature. The opportunity for Wembanyama to be closer to home in Paris and still play in the competitive EuroCup league will likely be attractive. Most NBA executives feel that Wembanyama simply staying healthy for the duration of next season, while showing progress with his thin frame and ability to handle physicality, should be enough to lock down the top spot. <br><br>In regard to Wembanyama's candidacy for the top pick, it's worth keeping a close eye on how the three big men who just heard their names called atop the 2022 NBA draft -- Jabari Smith, Chet Holmgren and Paolo Banchero -- fare as rookies. Not every executive agrees that selecting a big man at No. 1 is an ideal use of a team's resources, in terms of the value they return in the modern game. <br><br>Should Wembanyama struggle to stay healthy, or not improve as much as hoped, there's a group of extremely talented prospects right behind him looking to show there's a conversation about why big playmakers who can be the engine of an NBA offense deserve just as much consideration atop the draft. <em>-- Jonathan Givony</em></p> <p><strong>May 7, 2022</strong> <br><br>Wembanyama is the true prize of this class and the best prospect in the world regardless of age. I've long considered the 18-year-old French big man the best prospect I've personally ever evaluated, and at 7-3 with a 7-9 wingspan and 9-7 standing reach, he's starting to turn that sky-high potential into real production for the ASVEL team in France. <br><br>After missing some time because of injury earlier in the year, Wembanyama has hit stride over the past 10 games (EuroLeague and France Pro A), averaging 13.0 points, 5.9 rebounds and 2.5 blocks in 21.6 minutes while shooting 63% from 2 and 50% from 3. Even more impressive than the production has been how Wembanyama is getting his numbers. ASVEL is springing him free with off-ball screens like a wing, unleashing his feathery shooting touch. With his handle and footwork on display, he has been looking like a bigger Kevin Durant at times by splashing self-created step-back 3s. He's starting to add a more advanced midpost package, fading into back-shoulder turnarounds with incredible ease. He's getting to lobs no other player on the planet could even think of. On top of that, he's protecting the rim at an elite level -- well ahead of Rudy Gobert at the same stage -- while also showing the ability to step out and switch onto guards unlike any player we've previously seen at his height. Wembanyama is the only player in EuroLeague history to record a block percentage over 12%. <br><br>He still has his lapses on the defensive glass, can get a little overzealous offensively and with a lean frame has some questions to answer about his durability. But Wembanyama is a one-of-one-caliber prospect, a franchise changer and a future NBA MVP so long as he can stay healthy. He's the exact type of superstar that could quickly turn the Thunder into a playoff team and future contender the moment he puts on that Oklahoma City hat. <em>-- ESPN</em></p> <p><strong>Jan. 21, 2022</strong> <br><br>Projected No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama is a household name among draft die-hards by now. A prospect I've been evaluating closely since he was 13, the 7-3 phenom with a never-ending wingspan and rare skill level for his size does everything on both ends, and has already proved himself against this year's projected top pick, Holmgren, last summer on the FIBA circuit, going for 22 points, 8 boards and 8 blocks in a narrow loss to the United States. Likely the only thing that can hold him back from stardom are injuries, which he's battled this season with ASVEL given his height and thin frame. <em>-- ESPN</em></p> <p><strong>Jul. 14, 2021</strong> <br><br>Playing up by two years (and still eligible for the 2023 version of this event), Wembanyama was both the most impactful player in Latvia as well as the clear-cut best long-term prospect seen here. He thoroughly outplayed Holmgren in a thrilling head-to-head matchup despite being more than 18 months younger, and looked to be en route to carrying France to a historic gold medal before some very questionable whistles forced him to sit the final three minutes of what would become a loss to Team USA. <br><br>Still, Wembanyama more than made his point during his time on the floor, posting an impressive stat line of 22 points, 8 rebounds and 8 blocks in 27 minutes and coming up with several highlights on both ends of the floor that immediately went viral and showcased the incredibly unique talent he offers. He had a great case to be named MVP of the tournament. <br><br>Standing 7-foot-2 barefoot with a near-7-foot-9 wingspan and 9-foot-7-plus standing reach, Wembanyama is as fluid, graceful and coordinated a big man as you'll find, gliding up and down the floor, getting off the ground effortlessly for blocks and dunks, and displaying an uncommon skill set and feel for the game for a player his size and age. <br><br>He can score from anywhere on the floor, with a picture-perfect shooting stroke that will make him a dangerous 3-point threat in very short order, as well as the ball-handling ability, passing, interior footwork and touch needed to create his own shot inside the arc and score with an array of turnaround jumpers. He's an incredible presence as a lob-catching threat due to his reach, soft hands and the quickness with which he gets off his feet, and also knocked down 78% of his free throws to capitalize on the many attempts he inevitably draws from the charity stripe. <br><br>While exceptionally talented offensively, Wembanyama is even more impactful defensively at this stage, showing incredible instincts as a rim protector to go along with superb mobility and length. He regularly switches onto guards and shows terrific patience containing on the perimeter, staying down on fakes and then finishing plays with a block or strong contest. His work ethic, attitude and approach to the game match his extraordinary talent and give NBA talent evaluators plenty of room to be excited about his ability to reach his full potential. <br><br>Wembanyama will spend the next two years with Tony Parker's Euroleague club ASVEL in France before, barring any surprises, becoming the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft. He'll need to work on his lanky, 215-pound frame carefully to avoid injuries and show that his lack of strength won't be too much of an issue competing in arguably the most physical league in the world. <em>-- Jonathan Givony</em></p> <p><strong>Apr. 29, 2021</strong> <br><br>At 7-foot-2 barefoot, with a 7-foot-9 wingspan, a massive standing reach, winglike agility, soft touch from 3, tremendous timing as a shot-blocker and excellent feel as a passer, 17-year-old Victor Wembanyama is the world's most intriguing NBA prospect. I made the 14-hour drive from Belgrade, Serbia, to Strasbourg, France, to get an updated look at Wembanyama, whom we've been evaluating extensively since he was 13 years old and have highlighted everywhere from ESPN.com to SVP over the years. Although Wembanyama, who plays for Nanterre just outside of Paris, was handed a DNP in the first-division game against Strasbourg, we were able to watch an hourlong warm-up, evaluate his physical progression and sit down with the teenage sensation. <br><br>What exactly is it that Wembanyama believes is so fascinating to NBA scouts and executives? <br><br>\"The word I'd say is versatile,\" Wembanyama said of his game. \"Being able to score at any level, any moment in the game. Taking responsibilities. Maybe 'Mr. Do Everything.'\" <br><br>Wembanyama isn't NBA draft-eligible until 2023, but he is widely considered one of the best long-term prospects in the world, as long as he can remain healthy and stay on his current development path. The French player isn't nearly as polished as a prospect such as Paolo Banchero, the projected No. 1 pick in 2022, or even Chet Holmgren, who sits at No. 2 in 2022. You could surely make the argument that big playmakers such as Cade Cunningham are more valuable than bigs in today's NBA. <br><br>With the stagnant development of Emoni Bates, we've also been reminded of the dangers in tabbing young prospects \"the next big thing\" before they produce against elite competition. But to call Wembanyama the world's most intriguing prospect is not irresponsible or exaggerated. I've never seen a prospect quite like him, one whose learning curve figures to be aided by his perfect English, dedication to his craft and understanding of where he still needs to improve. <br><br>Although Wembanyama missed 2.5 months with a stress fracture in his lower leg, he is now starting to earn first-division minutes with Nanterre, most recently registering 12 points, six rebounds and two blocks in just 14 minutes in a win over Orleans. Wembanyama completely changed the game in the second half with his defensive presence and floor spacing. Not only can he shoot the 3 with incredible ease for his size, he already anchors a defense like a veteran with his instincts and timing. <em>-- ESPN</em></p> <p><strong>Feb. 12, 2020</strong> <br><br>Wembanyama wowed NBA scouts at ANGT, finishing the tourney with averages of 15.8 points, 12.0 rebounds, 6.0 blocks and 2.8 steals in just 28.1 minutes over the course of four games for Nanterre. The flashes he showed in key areas are unlike any player I've ever evaluated at that age. In his first interview with an American media outlet, Wembanyama said that he now stands over 7-foot-2 and weighs around 198 pounds, with a 7-foot-8 wingspan. <br><br>Of course, the prototypical NBA center is shrinking as the league gets smaller. But Wembanyama is different. <br><br>Despite his huge feet and thin frame, he moves like a wing. Not only does he put a lid on the rim like Rudy Gobert, he also shows the floor-spacing potential of a young Kristaps Porzingis, with a far better handle and passing feel. Wembanyama will push off the break into pull-up jumpers or throw long outlets or behind the back passes to open teammates. <br><br>\"That comes from the fact that I've always been balling since I was young,\" Wembanyama said. \"Even when I was not in a club yet, when I was 5 or 6 years old, I always had a ball.\" <br><br>Wembanyama knocked down spot-up and off-screen 3s, step-back jumpers, deep-corner turnarounds from the mid post and pull-ups unlike any other 7-foot-2 player in the world. Once he is surrounded by more talent, his passing vision should stand out even more. On top of that, he has a great approach to the game. He encourages his teammates, dives on the floor for loose balls and calls out defensive coverages. <br><br>There are a few minor drawbacks. He can improve as a defensive rebounder and become a more consistent 3-point shooter. He settles for jumpers a bit. And you never want to place too grand of expectations on a 16-year-old, especially one who will have to prove his body can hold up at the highest level. But he's checking all the boxes so far. <br><br>Had Wembanyama grown up in the United States, he would likely be a household name already; but he has been able to develop at his own pace in Europe. Last summer, the goal was the U16 European Championship. Wembanyama led the tournament in player efficiency rating (PER), rebound percentage and blocks per 40 minutes (9.0). This season, the goal was becoming a productive player for the under-21 Espoirs club. Wembanyama is averaging more than 20 points and 6.6 blocks per 40 minutes and posting a 25.8 PER through 13 games. <br><br>This summer, he'll star for France at the under-17 World Championships in Bulgaria. Then maybe next year he'll start to see more time with Nanterre's first team in France Pro A. France isn't known for its coaching or development system, so it'll be interesting to see how Wembanyama develops, especially physically. <br><br>\"I'm not focusing on [studying] one player; I'm trying to take things from every good player,\" Wembanyama said. \"I don't want to become a player who looks like another. I want everyone to refer to me like, 'I want to become like him.'\" <em>-- ESPN</em></p> <p><strong>Aug. 25, 2019</strong> <br><br>There's no other prospect in the world quite like 15-year-old, 7-foot-2 French wonder Victor Wembanyama. <br><br>The 2023 NBA draft is shaping up to be a generational crop given the likely age limit change in 2022 along with the incredible talent in the 2021 and 2022 high school classes, led by phenom Emoni Bates. Although still at an extremely early stage of development, Wembanyama is emerging as a potential co-star to Bates, health permitting. <br><br>Long and gangly with outstanding coordination, Wembanyama wowed NBA scouts with his tools, talent and production at the recent U16 European Championships in Udine, helping lead France to a silver medal while finishing the tournament first in PER. <br><br>Even with a paper-thin frame, Wembaynama posted record-breaking rim protection numbers, becoming the first player in FIBA history to block at least 9.0 shots per 40 minutes, swatting 37 total attempts in just 165 minutes. While blessed with never-ending arms surpassing the length of Rudy Gobert's, Wembanyama also has outstanding timing and a revved-up motor, giving him all the makings of an elite defensive anchor. He even showed the ability to step out and guard the perimeter some, sitting in a stance and clapping his hands, outwardly embracing the challenge. On top of the eye-opening rim protection and defensive versatility, Wembanyama hauled in 16.2 boards per 40 minutes thanks to his massive rebounding radius, often flying in on the offensive glass for tip-ins from different vantage points. <br><br>He'll surely hang his hat on shot-blocking, rebounding and lob-catching at the highest level, but unlike prior bigs in his mold, it's his feel for the game and advanced skill level that makes him such a rarity. <br><br>We've marvelled at physical prospects before, including Kristaps Porzingis, Joel Embiid, Mo Bamba, Rudy Gobert, Zhou Qi, Boban Marjanovic and 16-year-old Senegalese center Ibou Badji in recent years. But save for maybe Marjanovic, none of them were quite as advanced as Wembanyama at the same age in regard to skill and feel for the game. <br><br>Of course, it's far too early to pencil Wembanyama in as an NBA star, especially with the declining value of centers in today's game. Putting too grand of an expectation on a 15-year-old has proved faulty time and time again. But most of Wembanyama's shortcomings should dissolve with physical maturity, and the Nanterre product fits the modern game. He already has the skill foundation that's rare for bigs his age, especially those who can block shots and catch lobs. <br><br>He'll fire full-court outlets on the money, behind-the-back passes on the move or no-look dimes to shooters in the half court with either hand. Although he operated more as a roller and lob threat in Udine, watch Wembanyama warm up or play with Nanterre at the U18 level and you'll see him handle the ball fluidly and stretch the floor with soft touch, playing mostly on the perimeter. He gets excellent rotation from the free throw line even if the results are inconsistent, and he has the type of mechanics that should eventually allow him to space the floor out to 3 regularly. <br><br>Add in the passing feel, soft hands, ambidextrous touch and stretch potential to his frame, and it makes sense why NBA scouts struggled to find any comparison for him during what was, for most, their first extended viewing of the high-level prospect. Anything can happen over the next few years, but if it all hits, Wembanyama could certainly acquire unicorn status at the highest level. Whether or not Wembanyama is able to reach his sky-high potential will largely revolve around how he develops physically, as he has already grown almost four inches in less than 18 months. <br><br>With huge feet, big hands and a young frame, he could very well add another inch or two, and there simply isn't a track record of ultra-durable giants in the NBA (see Porzingis and Bol Bol). With that said, few over 7-foot players on the planet move like Wembanyama, and he has an outstanding support system full of current and former athletes. Watching him prepare for Nanterre U18 games or a U15 tournament in the past, he goes through long stretching routines and seems to have a great grasp on the importance of injury prevention. <br><br>It will be interesting to see at what level Wembanyama plays next season, as there's been some talk in scouting circles that he could spend time practicing with the first team in Nanterre -- his home club, where he recently agreed to a multiyear deal -- in the preseason. Regardless of whether he competes in the under-18 or under-21 level, Wembanyama, who is eligible to play in the U16s again next summer, made an everlasting first impression on NBA scouts in Udine. <em>-- ESPN</em></p> <p><strong>Apr. 8, 2018</strong> <br><br>The 2004-born French big man is gaining steam as one of the top long-term prospects in all of Europe. Most American prospects don't surface in scouting circles until age 15 or 16, but with the number of clubs and agents in Europe, the top players are generally identified much earlier with many turning pro as teenagers. Competing with his home club of Nanterre in the under-15 Lions Cup, Wembanyama showed his incredible physical upside and talent level for his age. <br><br>Wembanyama has massive hands, size 19.5 shoes, toothpick thighs and an incredible reach. For reference, Rudy Gobert was 6 inches shorter and playing on the wing when he was Wembanyama's age. While there have been plenty of young prospects with freakish measurements, it's Wembanyama skill level combined with his unique physical profile that makes him so intriguing. He shoots an easy 3-ball with soft touch, steps into midrange jumpers or floaters off the dribble, has a fairly advanced handle for his size and can pass with either hand, playing unselfishly. Despite his lack of lower-body strength, he's coordinated and competitive, protecting the rim impressively with sharp timing when fully engaged. Wembanyama's long-term success will depend on staying healthy and maintaining a strong physical regimen, as he's nowhere near his peak athletically. His development can shoot in a variety of directions, as he's skilled enough to trend toward a stretch big, long enough to become a lob-catcher/shot-blocker and talented enough with the ball to become a point-center type. <br><br>Highly touted, young prospects fail to live up to lofty expectations every year, but Wembanyama's background and support system makes us more comfortable even discussing him as a prospect at this age. His mother was described as the \"Kendrick Perkins of women's basketball in France\" for her tough mentality as a 6-3 big. Wembanyama's father was an accomplished long jumper, and his sister a champion basketball player on France's under-16 national team. His family is said to have a great grasp of the importance of developing him slowly. <br><br>Wembanyama played with Barcelona on loan at the 2018 Minicopa in Spain but long-term will stay with Nanterre. Next season he'll play in the France under-18 league while practicing with the under-21 team. <em>-- ESPN</em></p>"

      "text": "<b>Team context</b><br>The basketball gods smiled on San Antonio on lottery night, delivering the first overall pick to select a franchise-changing talent in Wembanyama. After toiling in mediocrity and not advancing past the first round of the playoffs since 2017, the Spurs finally went all-in on rebuilding and were awarded the most hyped prospect since LeBron James. They'll add him to a strong group of young wing and forward prospects in Jeremy Sochan, Devin Vassell, Keldon Johnson and Malaki Branham. San Antonio will hope to be competitive enough to vye for the playoffs sometime in the not-too-distant future, led by a rejuvenated Gregg Popovich hoping to leave on a positive note before retirement.<br><br><b>Player fit</b><br>Wembanyama would be a plug-and-play option on any roster, but his fit with the Spurs looks particularly snug. His extraordinary skill level should allow him to immediately become the primary target offensively on a team sorely lacking in shot-creation, while stepping to anchor a defense that ranked worst in the league last season. In Sochan, he has an ideal frontcourt partner who brings physicality, unselfishness, feel for the game, passing and defensive versatility. He's played quite a bit of center in his career, allowing him to bring Wembanyama's slight frame along slowly handling some of the more punishing matchups they might encounter. After playing 62 games without missing a single contest, the Spurs will likely want to be strategic about the load they put on him next year, especially if he represents France in the FIBA World Cup in August as expected. <i>-- Jonathan Givony</i>"
