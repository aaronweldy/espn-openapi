The team has already committed to a handful of key moves, including re-signing wideout Hollywood Brown to a one-year deal, placing the franchise tag on right guard Trey Smith and retaining linebacker Nick Bolton via a three-year contract. Mahomes remains signed through the 2031 season, and he'll enter the 2025 season with a reloaded supporting cast as the Chiefs work to bounce back from a disappointing 40-22 loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.","premium":false,"links":{"mobile":{"href":"http://m.espn.go.com/wireless/story?storyId=59720628"},"api":{"self":{}}},"allowSearch":false,"allowContentReactions":false,"playerId":3139477},{"id":59659628,"nowId":"23-59659628","contentKey":"59659628-23-1-1","dataSourceIdentifier":"7ea143ece9415","type":"Rotowire","headline":"Mahomes completed 21 of 32 pass attempts for 257 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions while taking four rushing attempts for 25 yards and a lost fumble in Sunday's 40-22 loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.","description":"Mahomes completed 21 of 32 pass attempts for 257 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions while taking four rushing attempts for 25 yards and a lost fumble in Sunday's 40-22 loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.","categorized":"2025-02-10T03:45:18Z","lastModified":"2025-02-10T03:45:18Z","published":"2025-02-10T03:45:18Z","images":[],"story":"Mahomes was stifled for nearly three quarters in Super Bowl LIX before completing the first of three garbage-time touchdowns with 34 seconds remaining in the third quarter of Sunday's one-sided affair. The 28-year-old superstar saw his hopes of a potential third consecutive Super Bowl title erode away with each ensuing unsuccessful offensive drive against a ferocious unit led by defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Mahomes saw a decline in total production in 2024 despite earning the top seed in the AFC, but he maintained a respectable 26:11 TD:INT in 16 starts in the regular season. The Chiefs will look to regroup following a disappointing showing on the national stage and bring in more talent to surround Mahomes for the upcoming 2025 campaign.","premium":false,"links":{"mobile":{"href":"http://m.espn.go.com/wireless/story?storyId=59659628"},"api":{"self":{}}},"allowSearch":false,"allowContentReactions":false,"playerId":3139477}]}
