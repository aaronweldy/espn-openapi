      "text": "Mahomes and star defensive tackle Chris Jones both agreed to restructure their contracts Wednesday, freeing up a total of $49.4 million in cap space to help Kansas City maneuver in free agency. The team has already committed to a handful of key moves, including re-signing wideout Hollywood Brown to a one-year deal, placing the franchise tag on right guard Trey Smith and retaining linebacker Nick Bolton via a three-year contract. Mahomes remains signed through the 2031 season, and he'll enter the 2025 season with a reloaded supporting cast as the Chiefs work to bounce back from a disappointing 40-22 loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.",
