After 18 years of pain, <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/team/royal-challengers-bengaluru-335970\">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/virat-kohli-253802\">Virat Kohli</a> have finally won the trophy.</p><p>After the trophy presentation, Kohli soaked in the win, walking into the RCB dressing room arm in arm with his former team-mate AB de Villiers. \"That's the heartbreak corner - no more,\" exclaimed Kohli.</p><p>Pointing at captain <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/rajat-patidar-823703\">Rajat Patidar</a>, Kohli said: \"What a turnaround. Injury replacement to IPL-winning captain,\" and then tossed one of his bats to Patidar.</p><p>Kohli tried to gather his thoughts about the title win, but it was yet to hit him fully. \"Very difficult to explain. I think I'm going to feel the real side of it when we get to Bangalore tomorrow and celebrate it with the city and the fans who stood with us through thick and thin. I'm just relieved.\" He also spent a moment appreciating his team-mates: \"Full bunch of match-winners. People stepping up at different stages, putting their hand up to get the job done for the team and just have that hunger and the quiet confidence in them. They just come and do the job.</p><p>He gestured towards <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/mayank-agarwal-398438\">Mayank Agarwal</a>, who replaced the injured Devdutt Padikkal in the squad. \"This guy, local [Bengaluru] lad, replaced Dev, another local boy - you could see they wear that badge with pride of RCB. That thing can never go away from a Bangalore boy\"</p><p>Agarwal chimed in, to tell Kohli what he means to the franchise and the city. \"You playing for Bangalore for 18 years - I can tell you one thing: you're as much of a Bangalore boy as anybody else. I'm sure you have an idea, but in tomorrow and the coming days, you'll really experience the love the city has for you.\"</p><inline1><p>And here's the moment when RCB won the IPL and Kohli fell to his knees on the ground.</p><inline2>"

With a runner at third base after a sacrifice bunt, Estrada retired <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39642/heliot-ramos\">Heliot Ramos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5134621/jung-hoo-lee\">Jung Hoo Lee</a> on grounders to shortstop to end it.\n\n\r\n              Ramos provided San Francisco\u2019s lone highlight at the plate with his 11th homer, a two-run shot in the third, but it wasn\u2019t enough to lift his team out of its offensive funk.\n\n\r\n              The Giants have scored four runs or fewer in 16 consecutive games, their second-longest such streak since moving to San Francisco in 1958.\n\n\r\n              Giants starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4345404/landen-roupp\">Landen Roupp</a> allowed four hits in 6 1/3 shutout innings.\n\n\r\n              Padres rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5196249/ryan-bergert\">Ryan Bergert</a>, called up from Triple-A El Paso before the game, allowed two runs and six hits over five innings in his first major league start.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key moment</hl2>\r\n              After the Padres' first two hitters reached base in the eighth, Giants third baseman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33857/matt-chapman\">Matt Chapman</a> made a terrific play to snag Merrill\u2019s grounder and then stepped on the bag before throwing across the diamond to complete the double play.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key stat</hl2>\r\n              Before giving up the tying runs in the ninth, Doval had not allowed a run in 20 2/3 innings. It was the longest active streak in the majors.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Up next</hl2>\r\n              Padres RHP <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36071/nick-pivetta\">Nick Pivetta</a> (6-2, 2.74 ERA) faces Giants LHP <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4683375/kyle-harrison\">Kyle Harrison</a> (1-1, 2.51) on Wednesday.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP MLB: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\">https://apnews.com/hub/MLB</a>"

Ashton Agar was not considered due to another calf injury.</p><alsosee></p><p><a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/josh-hazlewood-288284\">Josh Hazlewood</a> is the only one of Australia's three-format quicks who will not be rested for the series. Despite playing in the IPL final and being part of the World Test Championship final squad then the Test squad for the West Indies, Hazlewood will stay on to play the T20Is while Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc rest.</p><p>Travis Head, who also plays all international formats and the IPL, will also rest for the series. All three could return for the three-match series against South Africa which starts in Darwin on August 10.</p><h2>Bump in the road for Fraser-McGurk</h2><p>Fraser-McGurk, 23, was the most notable omission from the squad named for the series against West Indies that starts on July 20 in Jamaica immediately following the three-match Test series.</p><p>He had played in seven of Australia's last eight T20Is but had only passed 20 once, when he scored 50 off 31 balls against England last September batting at No. 3. In 19 T20s since then, including three T20Is against Pakistan, he has scored 290 runs at 15.26, striking at 136.15. He has two scores above 26 and one above 38, which was 95 off 46 in the final game of the BBL season. He was dropped by Delhi Capitals during the IPL season after scores of 1, 38, 0, 7, 0, and 9.</p><p>Fraser-McGurk was seen as the man who would be David Warner's immediate and permanent replacement in Australia's T20I side but will now be asked to return to domestic and franchise cricket to work on his craft. ESPNcricinfo understands there is a hope from the CA hierarchy that he is able to play a bit more four-day cricket for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield to help him work on his all-round batting and decision-making to supplement his raw ball-striking ability.</p><p>Owen, meanwhile, has been rewarded following his stunning BBL season by being named in the squad alongside T20I skipper <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/mitchell-marsh-272450\">Mitchell Marsh</a>, who returns to captain the side after missing Australia's last T20I series against Pakistan in November 2024 for paternity leave and Test preparation.</p><p><photo2></p><p>Owen scored two centuries for Hobart Hurricanes, including in the final to help them clinch their maiden title. His returns have been lean since then during stints in the SA20, PSL and IPL where he has scored just 116 runs in 11 innings with a highest score of 34.</p><p>Owen's BBL success for Hurricanes came at the top of the order but there will be a squeeze for positions, especially when Head is next in the squad. Marsh's form while opening for Lucknow Super Giants may entice the selectors to bed him down alongside Head as the opening pair for the T20 World Cup next year with <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/josh-inglis-662235\">Josh Inglis</a> looming as the obvious choice to bat at No. 3 given his impressive T20I record and his recent IPL form. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/matthew-short-605575\">Matthew Short</a> also remains a key part of Australia's top order plans and will return against West Indies having not played any cricket since injuring his quad in the Champions Trophy in late February.</p><h2>Question mark over Stoinis</h2><p>Owen could get a chance in a finishing role given the intriguing absence of Stoinis, who has been a bedrock of Australia's middle-order since the 2021 World Cup triumph and scored 61 not out of 27 balls in Australia's most recent T20I against Pakistan. He also played an important role in Punjab Kings' run to the IPL final.</p><p>Stoinis retired from ODI cricket on the eve on the Champions Trophy but is still available for T20I cricket. However, he does not hold a central contract and has a deal to play in the Hundred in August which overlaps with Australia's three T20Is against South Africa.</p><p>The series in the Caribbean marks the beginning of Australia's 2026 T20 World Cup preparation with the side set to play 16 T20Is in four series against West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand and India before the end of October.</p><p><photo3><p>There is a chance Stoinis remains in Australia's T20I plans for the World Cup given they have limited seam-bowling allrounder stocks and could return for the series against New Zealand and India in October.</p><p>Marsh is unlikely to bowl much if at all moving forward given his ongoing back issues while Green won't be able to bowl in a T20 until after the Ashes series assuming his return to bowling from back surgery goes according to plan. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/aaron-hardie-1124283\">Aaron Hardie</a> has been included in Australia's squad as the next seam-bowling allrounder while Owen could also be given a chance to fill a role with the ball but his experience is well shy of the other three.</p><p>Bartlett has slipped down the bowling pecking order despite being centrally contracted after also being overlooked for the Champions Trophy in February. Nathan Ellis will lead the seam attack alongside Hazlewood in the absence of Cummins and Starc while Ben Dwarshuis, Sean Abbott and Spencer Johnson are also in the squad as they were in the Champions Trophy.</p><p>Chair of selectors George Bailey reiterated that a number of the omissions could still make their way back into the squad ahead of the World Cup given the number of T20Is on the schedule over the coming months.</p><p>\"We have a busy T20 schedule coming up through this series, followed by three against South Africa and New Zealand and five matches against India at home as we continue to refine and build a squad we think will be the right fit for the World Cup on the subcontinent,\" Bailey said. \"There are a number of players outside the squad who can still force their way into the mix for those upcoming [series] and through the Big Bash.</p><p>\"The connection, role development and combinations we will have as options are growing nicely as we build towards the World Cup. It's an exciting time in our T20 space.\"</p><h2>Australia T20I squad vs West Indies</h2> Mitchell Marsh (capt), Sean Abbott, Cooper Connolly, Tim David, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie, Josh Hazlewood, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Matt Kuhnemann, Glenn Maxwell, Mitch Owen, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa"

      "story": "<video1><p><a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/virat-kohli-253802\">Virat Kohli</a> just didn't know what to do with himself. It had finally happened. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/josh-hazlewood-288284\">Josh Hazlewood</a> had bowled a dot ball on the second ball of the last over. Punjab Kings now needed 29 to win off the last four balls. He later suggested to <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/ab-de-villiers-44936\">AB de Villiers</a>, friend and former <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/team/royal-challengers-bengaluru-335970\">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</a> team-mate, with whom he put together many magical stands, that he was struggling to hold back tears. Now, though, it was mathematically impossible to lose if Hazlewood didn't concede extras. Kohli has faced enough of Hazlewood to know that wasn't going to happen.</p><p>It's funny. If you look back at any of RCB's interviews in the last week or so, you see signs of a team that believed this was their time. Their players signed off from New Chandigarh promising bigger celebrations on June 3. Kohli said that before the final he had told de Villiers that he wanted him to celebrate with them \"when\" they lifted the trophy at the end of the night.</p><p>And yet, when it does actually come around, you don't know what to do. As Kohli later said, he gave this team <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/virat-kohli-on-rcb-s-ipl-title-win-i-ve-given-this-team-everything-1488927\">his youth, his prime, his everything</a>, just for this moment. The team gave back. He came across players here who shaped his international career. Every year he dusted himself off and brought the same energy to the team. After the 2009 heartbreak, when he was just a kid. After 2016, when it seemed even more preordained than this year.</p><alsosee></p><p>You can trick your mind into believing there is no power that can stop you from winning, but when you have had that kind of history, you can't visualise what you will do after winning. On top of that, there are four balls to go before you can let yourself go completely.</p><p>At the end of the second ball, Kohli covered his face, and then covered even his eyes. The fingers came back wet. He had to wipe them on the back of his trousers. He was fielding at deep midwicket, one of the hot zones in the death overs that needs your best fielders. The next ball flew away for a six into the leg side. You have never seen Kohli react slower. He just jogged towards the ball and let someone from the infield retrieve it.</p><p>RCB coach <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2025-final-andy-flower-tremendous-respect-for-how-rajat-patidar-remained-calm-despite-scrutiny-1488979\">Andy Flower later acknowledged</a> that those who believe in fate would have a story to tell because geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan led to the suspension of <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924\">IPL 2025</a> just when Royal Challengers' campaign was flagging with injuries to Rajat Patidar and Hazlewood, which gave both players time to recover. Their opponents in the final, <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/wtc-final-bound-south-africa-players-set-to-miss-ipl-2025-playoffs-1485970\">PBKS, lost a key player</a> because the delay disrupted his team's WTC final preparations.</p><p>Try talking about fate to Kohli. He kept moving in circles as boundaries came off the last three balls. He looked deep into the stands. When you are struggling to hold back tears, looking into the distance helps. The same stands that mourned with him <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/india-vs-australia-final-1384439/full-scorecard\">on November 19 two years ago</a> were celebrating with him. A lot of them had come from Bengaluru. Not just English- and Kannada- and Dakhni-speaking fans, but also Tamil- and Hindi speakers who have settled in Bengaluru. The metro rides from Ahmedabad to Motera were jampacked and suffocating, but they endured it with discipline and joy. Perhaps they believe in fate.</p><p><inline2></p><p>The crowd for Qualifier 2 - on a Sunday - was only about half of this. Most of them were in the No. 18 knockoffs. Flight tickets from Bengaluru to Ahmedabad had risen to close to Rs 40,000 one way (over US$460). They still came. As they have been coming for 18 years. Never dunking on their team even when they were ridiculed for the team's performance.</p><p>One ball later, Kohli used the blue towel and threw it over the rope. It didn't matter if the ball was wet now. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/krunal-pandya-471342\">Krunal Pandya</a> began to celebrate after the fourth ball. He wouldn't know what Kohli was going through. This was Krunal's fourth title. His second Player of the Match in a final. He can't know the pain of waiting with the same side for 18 long years.</p><p>Kohli said there might have been moments of doubt in between, but he never seriously considered moving to any other franchise. He wanted to win his first IPL with RCB. Not many do, but he had found home at the first go. He gave his heart, soul, and now his experience to \"Bangalore\". This is where he went from wild child to lean, mean fighting machine to responsible statesman. At some point along the way, it became his forever home. No matter how much you trick yourself into believing you will win, when you are slowly winding down and retiring from one format after the other, surely there are times you wonder: what if you never win?</p><p>Before the last ball, Kohli threw away his cap as well. As the ball flew away for the final six, he sank to his knees with the grace of a Roger Federer icing one of his many Grand Slam wins when the opponent made an error. If there aren't any already, there will soon be split-screen edits showing both falling to their knees upon winning.</p><p><photo1><p>That it means enough to Kohli to bring him to tears is vindication of how important the IPL is and how utterly difficult winning it is. Kohli is someone who has won almost all there is to win in cricket. The IPL is still a young product. Not long ago, it started as a glorified holiday for overseas players. This tournament needed a buy-in from its big stars.</p><p>For 18 years, Kohli has given it his all, celebrating, anguishing, sledging, putting his reputation on the line beefing with kids, reinventing his game to triple the percentage of good-length balls he slogs. His tears of anguish, and now tears of joy, are perhaps the most glowing endorsement for the tournament.</p><p>Second only to the crowd. About three-fourths of the 92,000 people who turned up stayed back till the end of the bloated presentations that went on for nearly an hour and a half after the match ended. They all sounded like they had the night of their lives despite all the struggles of attending a match in India. People were on the phone telling their loved ones they were \"right there\" when \"we\" won. A lot of them were going to go straight to the airport or the train station because Ahmedabad just doesn't have enough hotels to accommodate everyone who comes to attend a match at the humongous stadium.</p><p>There were many chasing the team bus to the hotel. That RCB will get a much bigger celebration, most likely an open-top bus ride with the trophy, in Bengaluru is a matter of when more than if. By then, Kohli and the others will not be fumbling with their reactions. They will have slept like babies and woken up to confirm this is not just a dream. That they are the IPL champions.</p>"
