      "story": "<video1><p>Don't look at numbers. Just close your eyes and say if you think <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/krunal-pandya-471342\">Krunal Pandya</a> is among the ten best bowlers in the IPL. You will, of course, say yes on the day that he became the first to win multiple Player-of-the-Match awards in IPL finals, but answer seriously: does he have any business being in the list of top-ten bowlers in the best, most competitive T20 league in the world?</p><p>Now look at the numbers. He is among the top ten on every major metric in IPL 2025. He is <a href=\"https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=6;filter=advanced;orderby=wickets;spanmax1=31+Dec+2025;spanmin1=01+Jan+2025;spanval1=span;template=results;trophy=117;type=bowling\">No. 10 on most wickets</a>, No. 7 <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/tournament/bowling-best-career-economy-rate/indian-premier-league-2025-16622\">on economy</a> (among those who have bowled at least 25 overs), and <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924/most-impactful-bowlers\">No. 6 on ESPNcricinfo's list of most impactful bowlers</a>. Add to all that his <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924/delhi-capitals-vs-royal-challengers-bengaluru-46th-match-1473483/full-scorecard\">73 not out against Delhi Capitals</a> (DC), and you have ESPNcricinfo's second-most impactful performer of this IPL.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924/punjab-kings-vs-royal-challengers-bengaluru-final-1473511/full-scorecard\">This match</a> was the perfect example of why Krunal sneaks into these lists, why he is valued by champion sides - this was his fourth title, after all - despite not looking like he should be. He doesn't turn the ball big, he doesn't have the classic action to get him alarming dip or drift, he doesn't have mystery deliveries. But whatever he has is ideal for T20s: the right pace, the ability to pitch the ball where he wants to, the knowledge of where he should be pitching the ball, and a competitive streak.</p><alsosee></p><p>Krunal's combination of high pace and lengths almost provides him immunity from the shot that spinners hate the most: the sweep. All through this IPL, he has conceded just 65 runs to all the varieties of the sweep shot put together. Nine spinners have gone for more. In the final, they tried sweeping him twice but couldn't score a run. The option then for the batters is to either get a bad ball or try to manipulate the length by going deep into the crease or skipping down the track.</p><p>This is where Krunal shows his smarts. When a subdued <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/prabhsimran-singh-1161024\">Prabhsimran Singh</a> finally decided to step out against him, Krunal watched till the end and bowled his slowest delivery till then and also went wide because Prabhsimran looks to make room when he charges a spinner. Bowled at 81.49kph, this also turned the most till then and went out of Prabhsimran's reach.</p><p>When <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/josh-inglis-662235\">Josh Inglis</a>, Punjab Kings' (PBKS) best batter of the night, charged him, Krunal went the other route: bowling only his second 100kph-plus delivery and looking to cramp Inglis for room because he advances straight down. Both those balls created wickets, but it was as much the work around those deliveries that won <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/team/royal-challengers-bengaluru-335970\">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</a> (RCB) their first IPL final.</p><p><photo1><p>Krunal bowled unchanged for an analysis of 4-0-17-2 after RCB had been kept to 190, the <a href=\"https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=6;filter=advanced;ground=840;innings_number=1;orderby=team_score;season=2025;template=results;trophy=117;type=team;view=innings\">lowest first-innings score</a> all season in Ahmedabad. In his four overs, Krunal overpitched only once. And that was a yorker. There was nothing in the 2-4m zone that you can hit without stepping out. Only one delivery out of the 20 that he bowled to right-hand batters pitched more than a set of stumps wide.</p><p>Because Krunal relies on bowling into the pitch and tries to put work on the ball with his hand more than his action, he can tend to err on the shorter side. In T20 cricket, if you must err, it is better you do so on the shorter side. Still, only five balls went shorter than 7m, only one shorter than 8m.</p><p>The only boundary Krunal conceded was when he pitched shorter than 7m and also went really slow, probably his attempt to turn the ball big gone wrong. His pace ranged from 79.88 to 108.33. Krunal said it takes guts to slow the ball down in T20 even though it did seem to him going slow was the thing to do.</p><p>Coach <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/andy-flower-55427\">Andy Flower</a> said that RCB wanted Krunal precisely for his temperament, his experience of having been part of big matches. He repaid them immediately with <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924/kolkata-knight-riders-vs-royal-challengers-bengaluru-1st-match-1473438/full-scorecard\">his first match</a> in the RCB red. He was only beginning as he meant to end. Now he is one of only eight players to have <a href=\"https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=6;filter=advanced;final_type=1;groupby=players;result=1;template=results;trophy=117;type=team\">won four IPL finals</a>. Another top ten you wouldn't have bet on him making.</p>"

Six pitches later, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42547/anthony-volpe\">Anthony Volpe</a> drove a sweeper into the left-field stands, giving the Yankees back-to-back homers for the fifth time.\n\n\r\n              Rod\u00f3n (8-3) allowed one run and five hits in seven innings with eight strikeouts and one walk. He extended his scoreless streak to 20 innings and retired 17 straight batters entering the seventh, when Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez singled, stole second and came around when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41672/david-fry\">David Fry</a> bounced a single past <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30765/dj-lemahieu\">DJ LeMahieu</a> at second base.
