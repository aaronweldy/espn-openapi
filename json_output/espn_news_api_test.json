It's just one of those things where everyone kind of gets excited, and then you go out there and want to do your part and go out there and put up 10 runs.\"</p>\n<p>Caglianone batted sixth as the Royals' designated hitter.</p>\n<p>He stepped up to the plate for the first time to lead off the second inning to loud cheers from a crowd that featured plenty of Royals fans who ventured across the state to see the sixth overall pick of the 2024 amateur draft's debut.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"That was awesome,\" Caglianone said. \"That's something I'll definitely remember forever. I can't really thank the people for coming out like that and showing their support and stuff like that. I'm just grateful for it.\"</p>\n<p>Caliganone lined a 1-2 pitch from <a data-player-guid=\"5ac1018a-9135-3239-9b4c-dc31c11826f8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4109034/andre-pallante\">Andre Pallante</a> to the right-center field warning track where Cardinals center fielder <a data-player-guid=\"2cdb33ba-3cf7-339d-b27a-43f6a316f54f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4807220/victor-scott-ii\">Victor Scott II</a> raced 92 feet to make a running catch just steps away from the outfield wall.</p>\n<p>Caglianone came close to picking up his first career hit on groundouts to Cardinals third baseman <a data-player-guid=\"72db1157-54ca-3b99-805f-4f186b85cd8a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31261/nolan-arenado\">Nolan Arenado</a> in the fifth and seventh innings, but the 10-time Gold Glove Award winner made off-balance throws on both plays to nail him at first base.</p>\n<p>\"He was great in the dugout,\" Royals manager Matt Quatraro said. \"He went up there, attacked. I think it was a bad idea to hit it to those two guys his first two at bats. There's a really, really good catch in the first at bat, and then anything you hit to Arenado is not really a great idea. But he squared it up. He was ready to go. He looked poised. There will be plenty of hits for him.\"</p>\n<p>Caglianone was facing Oklahoma State as a member of the Florida Gators in the NCAA baseball tournament at this time a year ago. On Tuesday night, he played in front of 26,656 fans.</p>\n<p>\"The first time I stepped out onto the field, just wanted to check out the field and stuff, my initial thought was these places really are like, kind of fish bowls,\" Caglianone said. \"The grandstands just keep going up forever it felt like, but it was nice.\"</p>\n<p>The 22-year-old Caglianone hit .319 with nine home runs and 43 RBIs in 38 games with Triple-A Omaha after playing the first 12 games of the season with Double-A Northwest Arkansas -- living up to the lofty expectations the Royals had when they drafted him.</p>\n<p>\"We were really excited when he got to us,\" Royals general manager J.J. Picollo recalled. \"What we didn't know is, how long does it take? You never know how long it's going to take, and if it took one year or two years, as long as he becomes a good major league player, we'd be fine with it.</p>\n<p>\"So, there was no real need, coming into this year, to see him up in '25, but he went out and did what you want players to do.\"</p>\n<p>Caglianone's new big league teammates, however, aren't looking for him to be a hero.</p>\n<p>\"Where I would caution him is like he's not a savior to this offense, nor should he think he think he is, nor should anybody think he is because that's super unfair,\" Royals first baseman <a data-player-guid=\"1504857a-3703-3a40-95e4-f56bcf111a37\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4109109/vinnie-pasquantino\">Vinnie Pasquantino</a> said. \"He needs to come into this lineup and be his best self because his best self is what helps us the most, not him trying to do too much or to try to save the offense.\"</p>\n\n\n\n"

It was their eighth loss in 10 games. They are now 9-10-1 in series play, including 4-5-1 at Fenway Park.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>\"We keep making the same mistakes. We're not getting better,\" Cora said after the game. \"At one point it has to be on me I guess. I'm the manager. I've got to keep pushing them to be better. They're not getting better. They're not. We keep making the same mistakes. I'll be honest about it and very open about it.\"</p>\n<p>Tuesday's loss came a night after Boston also lost by a run to an Angels team that had lost seven of eight and three consecutive series.</p>\n<p>The game started out with some promise.</p>\n<p>Starting pitcher <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4720856/brayan-bello\">Brayan Bello</a> pitched a scoreless first to snap a four-game streak of Boston pitchers allowing at least one run in the opening inning.</p>\n<p>But then the Angels took a 3-0 lead in the third inning via an RBI single by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4666100/zach-neto\">Zach Neto</a> and a two-run single by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4739755/nolan-schanuel\">Nolan Schanuel</a>.</p>\n<p>Boston got one run back during its half of the inning but failed to close the gap more despite having runners on second and third base with no outs.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox outhit the Angels for the second straight game. But also also committed three fielding errors.</p>\n<p>\"You get frustrated, but at one point, OK, what are you going to do? What's going to change? We keep doing the same thing,\" Cora said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"

      "story": "SEATTLE -- \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4416990/colton-cowser\">Colton Cowser</a> homered in his first game since <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-orioles-colton-cowser-8d4cc7f37652fbe899369500daf19a3c\">being activated from the 60-day injured list</a> as the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a> beat the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a> 5-1 on Tuesday night. \n\n\r\n              Cowser, who hadn\u2019t played in a major league game since March 30 due to a broken left thumb, <a href=\"https://x.com/Orioles/status/1930100760831733928\">cranked a solo shot to left field in the sixth inning for his second home run</a>. It was Cowser\u2019s first home run since March 29, and came shortly after Mariners right-hander <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42406/george-kirby\">George Kirby</a> (0-3) <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mariners-kirby-face-8fc14fe5c006047da19fe4a5ece6d590\">exited after taking a line drive off his face</a>. \n\n\r\n              The Orioles tagged Kirby for two runs, one in the first inning on a sacrifice fly by Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas and another in the fifth inning on an RBI single by Ryan O\u2019Hearn. Baltimore added two more run in the ninth inning. \n\n\r\n              Orioles right-hander <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4142423/tomoyuki-sugano\">Tomoyuki Sugano</a> (5-3), meanwhile, was superb. The 35-year-old rookie yielded just one run across seven innings, with the lone blemish being a solo home run by Seattle first baseman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34287/rowdy-tellez\">Rowdy Tellez</a>. \n\n\r\n              The Mariners struggled against the Orioles\u2019 bullpen before dropping their 27th game of the season. \n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key moment</hl2>\r\n              With two outs in the fifth inning, Kirby threw a fastball inside to Ur\u00edas, which he promptly ripped right back up the middle. The baseball made contact with Kirby\u2019s face, and he immediately jogged off the field as blood flowed from his mouth. Kirby did not return for the sixth inning.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key stat</hl2>\r\n              Cowser has reached base safely in all seven career games against Seattle. He\u2019s gone 8 for 20 against the Mariners with two doubles, three RBI and seven walks. \n\n\r\n              <hl2>Up next</hl2>\r\n              Seattle right-hander <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4297897/emerson-hancock\">Emerson Hancock</a> (2-2, 5.64 ERA) starts Wednesday. Right-hander <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5085743/cade-povich\">Cade Povich</a> (1-4, 5.29) will start for the Orioles in the second game of the three-game set. \n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP MLB: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\">https://apnews.com/hub/MLB</a>"

      "story": "<video1><p><a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/virat-kohli-253802\">Virat Kohli</a> just didn't know what to do with himself. It had finally happened. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/josh-hazlewood-288284\">Josh Hazlewood</a> had bowled a dot ball on the second ball of the last over. Punjab Kings now needed 29 to win off the last four balls. He later suggested to <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/ab-de-villiers-44936\">AB de Villiers</a>, friend and former <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/team/royal-challengers-bengaluru-335970\">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</a> team-mate, with whom he put together many magical stands, that he was struggling to hold back tears. Now, though, it was mathematically impossible to lose if Hazlewood didn't concede extras. Kohli has faced enough of Hazlewood to know that wasn't going to happen.</p><p>It's funny. If you look back at any of RCB's interviews in the last week or so, you see signs of a team that believed this was their time. Their players signed off from New Chandigarh promising bigger celebrations on June 3. Kohli said that before the final he had told de Villiers that he wanted him to celebrate with them \"when\" they lifted the trophy at the end of the night.</p><p>And yet, when it does actually come around, you don't know what to do. As Kohli later said, he gave this team <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/virat-kohli-on-rcb-s-ipl-title-win-i-ve-given-this-team-everything-1488927\">his youth, his prime, his everything</a>, just for this moment. The team gave back. He came across players here who shaped his international career. Every year he dusted himself off and brought the same energy to the team. After the 2009 heartbreak, when he was just a kid. After 2016, when it seemed even more preordained than this year.</p><alsosee></p><p>You can trick your mind into believing there is no power that can stop you from winning, but when you have had that kind of history, you can't visualise what you will do after winning. On top of that, there are four balls to go before you can let yourself go completely.</p><p>At the end of the second ball, Kohli covered his face, and then covered even his eyes. The fingers came back wet. He had to wipe them on the back of his trousers. He was fielding at deep midwicket, one of the hot zones in the death overs that needs your best fielders. The next ball flew away for a six into the leg side. You have never seen Kohli react slower. He just jogged towards the ball and let someone from the infield retrieve it.</p><p>RCB coach <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2025-final-andy-flower-tremendous-respect-for-how-rajat-patidar-remained-calm-despite-scrutiny-1488979\">Andy Flower later acknowledged</a> that those who believe in fate would have a story to tell because geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan led to the suspension of <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924\">IPL 2025</a> just when Royal Challengers' campaign was flagging with injuries to Rajat Patidar and Hazlewood, which gave both players time to recover. Their opponents in the final, <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/wtc-final-bound-south-africa-players-set-to-miss-ipl-2025-playoffs-1485970\">PBKS, lost a key player</a> because the delay disrupted his team's WTC final preparations.</p><p>Try talking about fate to Kohli. He kept moving in circles as boundaries came off the last three balls. He looked deep into the stands. When you are struggling to hold back tears, looking into the distance helps. The same stands that mourned with him <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/india-vs-australia-final-1384439/full-scorecard\">on November 19 two years ago</a> were celebrating with him. A lot of them had come from Bengaluru. Not just English- and Kannada- and Dakhni-speaking fans, but also Tamil- and Hindi speakers who have settled in Bengaluru. The metro rides from Ahmedabad to Motera were jampacked and suffocating, but they endured it with discipline and joy. Perhaps they believe in fate.</p><p><inline2></p><p>The crowd for Qualifier 2 - on a Sunday - was only about half of this. Most of them were in the No. 18 knockoffs. Flight tickets from Bengaluru to Ahmedabad had risen to close to Rs 40,000 one way (over US$460). They still came. As they have been coming for 18 years. Never dunking on their team even when they were ridiculed for the team's performance.</p><p>One ball later, Kohli used the blue towel and threw it over the rope. It didn't matter if the ball was wet now. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/krunal-pandya-471342\">Krunal Pandya</a> began to celebrate after the fourth ball. He wouldn't know what Kohli was going through. This was Krunal's fourth title. His second Player of the Match in a final. He can't know the pain of waiting with the same side for 18 long years.</p><p>Kohli said there might have been moments of doubt in between, but he never seriously considered moving to any other franchise. He wanted to win his first IPL with RCB. Not many do, but he had found home at the first go. He gave his heart, soul, and now his experience to \"Bangalore\". This is where he went from wild child to lean, mean fighting machine to responsible statesman. At some point along the way, it became his forever home. No matter how much you trick yourself into believing you will win, when you are slowly winding down and retiring from one format after the other, surely there are times you wonder: what if you never win?</p><p>Before the last ball, Kohli threw away his cap as well. As the ball flew away for the final six, he sank to his knees with the grace of a Roger Federer icing one of his many Grand Slam wins when the opponent made an error. If there aren't any already, there will soon be split-screen edits showing both falling to their knees upon winning.</p><p><photo1><p>That it means enough to Kohli to bring him to tears is vindication of how important the IPL is and how utterly difficult winning it is. Kohli is someone who has won almost all there is to win in cricket. The IPL is still a young product. Not long ago, it started as a glorified holiday for overseas players. This tournament needed a buy-in from its big stars.</p><p>For 18 years, Kohli has given it his all, celebrating, anguishing, sledging, putting his reputation on the line beefing with kids, reinventing his game to triple the percentage of good-length balls he slogs. His tears of anguish, and now tears of joy, are perhaps the most glowing endorsement for the tournament.</p><p>Second only to the crowd. About three-fourths of the 92,000 people who turned up stayed back till the end of the bloated presentations that went on for nearly an hour and a half after the match ended. They all sounded like they had the night of their lives despite all the struggles of attending a match in India. People were on the phone telling their loved ones they were \"right there\" when \"we\" won. A lot of them were going to go straight to the airport or the train station because Ahmedabad just doesn't have enough hotels to accommodate everyone who comes to attend a match at the humongous stadium.</p><p>There were many chasing the team bus to the hotel. That RCB will get a much bigger celebration, most likely an open-top bus ride with the trophy, in Bengaluru is a matter of when more than if. By then, Kohli and the others will not be fumbling with their reactions. They will have slept like babies and woken up to confirm this is not just a dream. That they are the IPL champions.</p>"

After it was upgraded to a flagrant 1, Diggins made the free throw and Seattle retained possession, leading to Ezi Magbegor\u2019s basket for a 74-63 lead.\n\n\r\n              Magbegor\u2019s shot capped Seattle\u2019s 18-4 run as Dallas went without a field goal for five-plus minutes, missing eight straight shots.\n\n\r\n              Wheeler scored all 11 of her points in the second half, to go with seven assists, for Seattle (4-4). Diggins had just nine points to end her 22-game streak with at least 10 points \u2014 the third longest active streak in the league. The Storm got 30 points from their bench players.\n\n\r\n              DiJonai Carrington led Dallas (1-7) with 22 points. Myisha Hines-Allen had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and Maddy Siegrist added 11 and nine. Arike Ogunbowale was held to eight points on 4-of-15 shooting.\n\n\r\n              Luisa Geiselsoder made a wide open 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer to extend the Dallas lead to 38-30 at the break. \n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP WNBA: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball\">https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball</a>\n\n\r\n"
