But they also were annoyed, whether they admitted it publicly or not, that 10 teams were playing five games on the NBA's marquee day -- and they were spectators.</p>\n<p>They'd won a league-best 57 games the season before and had one of the top players in the league,\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"4dcec409-3ff9-2881-2bc3-b4289ce6c36d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander\">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a>, the previous season's MVP runner-up whom the NBA perhaps should've been featuring on its highest-profile day. The Thunder also were 23-5 at that point and on an eight-game win streak -- and not playing on Dec. 25 was looking kind of ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Their hosts for a pedestrian non-national-television game on Dec. 26 were the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"547fc042-3e02-4795-9637-9ab84322b625\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers\">Indiana Pacers</a>. The Pacers had rolled their eyes four months earlier when the schedule read that <em>they</em> weren't playing on Christmas Day, despite making the Eastern Conference finals the season prior. It was the 20th consecutive year the Pacers had been deemed not worthy of a Christmas game.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, this was an ironic moment in the season: The two teams that eventually would meet in the NBA Finals were together on the headline day for the league; they were just living the lives of small-market underdogs.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>They ended up staging a terrific game that everyone would be thrilled to see repeated over the next two weeks.</p>\n<p>The Pacers, still overcoming early-season injuries and malaise, were just a .500 team at the time, but they led the Dec. 26 contest for most of the way, and by as much as 16 points, even though star guard\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton\">Tyrese Haliburton</a> was held to just four points.</p>\n<p>But the Thunder, relentless in their precision, turned the ball over only three times and cut off Indiana's classic game plan of crushing the opponent's mistakes. Gilgeous-Alexander tied his career high with 45 points, 16 of them coming in the fourth quarter, including a cold-blooded 3-pointer with just under a minute left with\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"5bee0335-89c7-30ba-9cdc-097e17878ac6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683634/bennedict-mathurin\">Bennedict Mathurin</a>\u00a0in his face.

Down four with 3:42 to play after a 7-0 Pacers run, Oklahoma City ripped off eight consecutive points to take control, with <a data-player-guid=\"2381f346-9247-3ba1-b632-fcef378a2799\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4593803/jalen-williams\">Jalen Williams</a> scoring half of them. Gilgeous-Alexander was still the standout with 45 points on 15-of-22 shooting, including four 3-pointers in five attempts, plus a perfect 11-for-11 night at the foul line.</p>\n<p>There was little such drama when the Thunder hosted Indiana on March 29. Oklahoma City opened up a 22-point lead after three quarters. The Thunder knocked down 17 3-pointers, including six from Lu Dort and five off the bench from <a data-player-guid=\"df47e397-5af2-42fa-965a-0574219eec8d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395702/isaiah-joe\">Isaiah Joe</a>. <i> -- Kevin Pelton</i></p>\n\n\n<p><a name=\"questions\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>How many times will this Oklahoma City core get to this stage?</h2>\n<p>The NBA is at the peak of parity, preparing to crown a new champion for the seventh straight season, but the Thunder have dynasty potential. This is the second-youngest team (average age: 25.6 years) to advance to the Finals, trailing only the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a>' 1976-77 championship team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. A deep Thunder roster is built around a 26-year-old MVP in Gilgeous-Alexander, a 24-year-old All-NBA selection in Williams and a 23-year-old potential future Defensive Player of the Year in Holmgren. Plus, general manager Sam Presti has accumulated 13 first-round picks over the next seven drafts. Oklahoma City's last Finals team -- which featured MVPs <a data-player-guid=\"dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"e849e50f-b1b7-4256-1de2-ca49862e218d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook\">Russell Westbrook</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"35b0f455-b1df-0986-121d-27d2b6c18122\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a> -- is a case study in future success never being guaranteed in the NBA. But the Thunder enter the Finals as a heavy favorite, and it's easy to envision them becoming June regulars. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<h2>Can Indiana win a strength vs. strength battle?</h2>\n<p>The Thunder's defense will easily be the toughest challenge for the Pacers to solve -- a healthy, swarming juggernaut unit with youth and speed that can match and, perhaps, thrive in Indiana's up-tempo style. The Pacers have benefited from seemingly catching each of their playoff opponents by surprise with their speed, putting opposing teams on their heels and forcing them into uncharacteristic styles and mistakes. Indiana will enter the series with more experience, and Carlisle will continue to try to find a way to dictate the terms of the series as he has in each of the previous three rounds. But the gap between the top of the West and the East has seemed wide for most of the season, which is why Oklahoma City enters the series as a heavy favorite. The Pacers have thrived in their underdog role all postseason. Can they find a way to pull off one more massive upset? <i>-- Collier</i></p>\n<p><a name=\"matchup\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Matchup to watch for the series</h2>\n<p><strong><a data-player-guid=\"c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton\">Tyrese Haliburton</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"7f199b67-58d7-790d-458c-29e62293032b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397020/luguentz-dort\">Luguentz Dort</a></strong></p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>The All-NBA guard against the first-team All-Defense stopper. Haliburton is the engine who makes the Pacers go, but he hasn't worked that way against Dort. Over the past two seasons, Haliburton averaged just 12 points per game against the Thunder, his fewest against any opponent, and he attempted shots at a lower rate when guarded by Dort than any other defender, according to GeniusIQ tracking.</p>\n<p>If the Thunder can slow Haliburton like they have in the regular season, and thereby gum up the works of Indiana's offense, this series won't last very long. If Haliburton can solve Dort's physical defense and keep the Pacers humming, however, Indiana has a chance to shock the world and upset the title favorites. <i> -- Zach Kram</i></p>\n<p><a name=\"win\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Thunder can win it all</h2>\n<p>By doing what they've been doing throughout the regular season and playoffs. A Finals win would complete a historic season for Oklahoma City, which posted the best point differential ever in the regular season (plus-12.9 PPG) and has the best for any team heading into the Finals (plus-10.8) since both the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> in 2017.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the Thunder will win this series as long as they continue controlling the turnover differential, which has proved to be a key stat throughout the playoffs. Oklahoma City is simultaneously forcing far more turnovers than any other team (18.0 per game) while averaging fewer on offense than any team that advanced past the first round (11.6). That advantage of 6.4 per game would be the highest for a team that played multiple series since the league began tracking team turnovers in 1973-74. <i>-- Pelton</i></p>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n<h2>How the Pacers can win it all</h2>\n<p>Indiana's path to the Larry O'Brien Trophy involves three steps.</p>\n<p>First, the Pacers can't lose the turnover battle by as drastic a margin as every other Thunder opponent. There are encouraging signs here: Haliburton ranks as one of the lowest-turnover guards in the league, and Indiana ranked third in both the regular season and postseason in lowest turnover rate. Taking care of the ball will limit Oklahoma City's demoralizing, game-breaking transition sequences.</p>\n<p>Second, the Pacers need to win the 3-point battle by a wide margin. Again, there's reason for hope here, as Indiana leads all playoff teams with a 40.1% 3-point mark, while Oklahoma City's shooters have collectively struggled (33.6% this postseason).</p>\n<p>And finally, the Pacers have to win close games. The Thunder are sufficiently dominant that they should expect a blowout win or two in the Finals; they've won at least one game by 30-plus points in every series so far. But if Indiana can win the non-blowouts, an upset is possible. The Pacers are 7-1 in clutch games in the playoffs. <i>-- Kram</i></p>\n\n\n\n\n"
