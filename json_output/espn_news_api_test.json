But they also were annoyed, whether they admitted it publicly or not, that 10 teams were playing five games on the NBA's marquee day -- and they were spectators.</p>\n<p>They'd won a league-best 57 games the season before and had one of the top players in the league,\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"4dcec409-3ff9-2881-2bc3-b4289ce6c36d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander\">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a>, the previous season's MVP runner-up whom the NBA perhaps should've been featuring on its highest-profile day. The Thunder also were 23-5 at that point and on an eight-game win streak -- and not playing on Dec. 25 was looking kind of ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Their hosts for a pedestrian non-national-television game on Dec. 26 were the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"547fc042-3e02-4795-9637-9ab84322b625\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers\">Indiana Pacers</a>. The Pacers had rolled their eyes four months earlier when the schedule read that <em>they</em> weren't playing on Christmas Day, despite making the Eastern Conference finals the season prior. It was the 20th consecutive year the Pacers had been deemed not worthy of a Christmas game.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, this was an ironic moment in the season: The two teams that eventually would meet in the NBA Finals were together on the headline day for the league; they were just living the lives of small-market underdogs.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>They ended up staging a terrific game that everyone would be thrilled to see repeated over the next two weeks.</p>\n<p>The Pacers, still overcoming early-season injuries and malaise, were just a .500 team at the time, but they led the Dec. 26 contest for most of the way, and by as much as 16 points, even though star guard\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton\">Tyrese Haliburton</a> was held to just four points.</p>\n<p>But the Thunder, relentless in their precision, turned the ball over only three times and cut off Indiana's classic game plan of crushing the opponent's mistakes. Gilgeous-Alexander tied his career high with 45 points, 16 of them coming in the fourth quarter, including a cold-blooded 3-pointer with just under a minute left with\u00a0<a data-player-guid=\"5bee0335-89c7-30ba-9cdc-097e17878ac6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683634/bennedict-mathurin\">Bennedict Mathurin</a>\u00a0in his face.

Down four with 3:42 to play after a 7-0 Pacers run, Oklahoma City ripped off eight consecutive points to take control, with <a data-player-guid=\"2381f346-9247-3ba1-b632-fcef378a2799\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4593803/jalen-williams\">Jalen Williams</a> scoring half of them. Gilgeous-Alexander was still the standout with 45 points on 15-of-22 shooting, including four 3-pointers in five attempts, plus a perfect 11-for-11 night at the foul line.</p>\n<p>There was little such drama when the Thunder hosted Indiana on March 29. Oklahoma City opened up a 22-point lead after three quarters. The Thunder knocked down 17 3-pointers, including six from Lu Dort and five off the bench from <a data-player-guid=\"df47e397-5af2-42fa-965a-0574219eec8d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395702/isaiah-joe\">Isaiah Joe</a>. <i> -- Kevin Pelton</i></p>\n\n\n<p><a name=\"questions\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>How many times will this Oklahoma City core get to this stage?</h2>\n<p>The NBA is at the peak of parity, preparing to crown a new champion for the seventh straight season, but the Thunder have dynasty potential. This is the second-youngest team (average age: 25.6 years) to advance to the Finals, trailing only the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a>' 1976-77 championship team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. A deep Thunder roster is built around a 26-year-old MVP in Gilgeous-Alexander, a 24-year-old All-NBA selection in Williams and a 23-year-old potential future Defensive Player of the Year in Holmgren. Plus, general manager Sam Presti has accumulated 13 first-round picks over the next seven drafts. Oklahoma City's last Finals team -- which featured MVPs <a data-player-guid=\"dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"e849e50f-b1b7-4256-1de2-ca49862e218d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook\">Russell Westbrook</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"35b0f455-b1df-0986-121d-27d2b6c18122\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a> -- is a case study in future success never being guaranteed in the NBA. But the Thunder enter the Finals as a heavy favorite, and it's easy to envision them becoming June regulars. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<h2>Can Indiana win a strength vs. strength battle?</h2>\n<p>The Thunder's defense will easily be the toughest challenge for the Pacers to solve -- a healthy, swarming juggernaut unit with youth and speed that can match and, perhaps, thrive in Indiana's up-tempo style. The Pacers have benefited from seemingly catching each of their playoff opponents by surprise with their speed, putting opposing teams on their heels and forcing them into uncharacteristic styles and mistakes. Indiana will enter the series with more experience, and Carlisle will continue to try to find a way to dictate the terms of the series as he has in each of the previous three rounds. But the gap between the top of the West and the East has seemed wide for most of the season, which is why Oklahoma City enters the series as a heavy favorite. The Pacers have thrived in their underdog role all postseason. Can they find a way to pull off one more massive upset? <i>-- Collier</i></p>\n<p><a name=\"matchup\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Matchup to watch for the series</h2>\n<p><strong><a data-player-guid=\"c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton\">Tyrese Haliburton</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"7f199b67-58d7-790d-458c-29e62293032b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397020/luguentz-dort\">Luguentz Dort</a></strong></p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>The All-NBA guard against the first-team All-Defense stopper. Haliburton is the engine who makes the Pacers go, but he hasn't worked that way against Dort. Over the past two seasons, Haliburton averaged just 12 points per game against the Thunder, his fewest against any opponent, and he attempted shots at a lower rate when guarded by Dort than any other defender, according to GeniusIQ tracking.</p>\n<p>If the Thunder can slow Haliburton like they have in the regular season, and thereby gum up the works of Indiana's offense, this series won't last very long. If Haliburton can solve Dort's physical defense and keep the Pacers humming, however, Indiana has a chance to shock the world and upset the title favorites. <i> -- Zach Kram</i></p>\n<p><a name=\"win\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Thunder can win it all</h2>\n<p>By doing what they've been doing throughout the regular season and playoffs. A Finals win would complete a historic season for Oklahoma City, which posted the best point differential ever in the regular season (plus-12.9 PPG) and has the best for any team heading into the Finals (plus-10.8) since both the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> in 2017.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the Thunder will win this series as long as they continue controlling the turnover differential, which has proved to be a key stat throughout the playoffs. Oklahoma City is simultaneously forcing far more turnovers than any other team (18.0 per game) while averaging fewer on offense than any team that advanced past the first round (11.6). That advantage of 6.4 per game would be the highest for a team that played multiple series since the league began tracking team turnovers in 1973-74. <i>-- Pelton</i></p>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n<h2>How the Pacers can win it all</h2>\n<p>Indiana's path to the Larry O'Brien Trophy involves three steps.</p>\n<p>First, the Pacers can't lose the turnover battle by as drastic a margin as every other Thunder opponent. There are encouraging signs here: Haliburton ranks as one of the lowest-turnover guards in the league, and Indiana ranked third in both the regular season and postseason in lowest turnover rate. Taking care of the ball will limit Oklahoma City's demoralizing, game-breaking transition sequences.</p>\n<p>Second, the Pacers need to win the 3-point battle by a wide margin. Again, there's reason for hope here, as Indiana leads all playoff teams with a 40.1% 3-point mark, while Oklahoma City's shooters have collectively struggled (33.6% this postseason).</p>\n<p>And finally, the Pacers have to win close games. The Thunder are sufficiently dominant that they should expect a blowout win or two in the Finals; they've won at least one game by 30-plus points in every series so far. But if Indiana can win the non-blowouts, an upset is possible. The Pacers are 7-1 in clutch games in the playoffs. <i>-- Kram</i></p>\n\n\n\n\n"

      "story": "<p>A stacked 2025 NCAA Division I baseball championship is underway, and it has been full of upsets.</p>\n<p>Vanderbilt, the national No. 1 seed, was eliminated in the Nashville Regional after losing to Wright State 5-4. It's the first time the national No. 1 seed didn't reach the regional final, and it's just the fourth time the National No. 1 seed did not reach a super regional (UCLA in 2015, Oregon State in 2014, Vanderbilt in 2007). Then UTSA played spoiler and eliminated No. 2 Texas in the Austin Regional to advance to its first ever super regionals.\u00a0Since national seeds were introduced in 1999, there has only been one year where the top two were both eliminated in regionals -- 2014 with No. 1 Oregon State and No. 2 Florida losing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The No. 11 Clemson Tigers were ousted as well on Sunday along with the No. 7 Georgia Bulldogs, and earlier this weekend, No. 12 Oregon\u00a0exited.</p>\n<p>Aside from those dramatic exits, Sunday has seen eight additional teams advance to super regionals, including No. 3 Arkansas, No. 4 Auburn, No. 9 Florida State, Louisville (which ultimately sent home Wright State), West Virginia, Coastal Carolina, Arizona and Duke.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coming up Monday, Wake Forest and Tennessee will face each other again in the Knoxville Regional, and Oklahoma forced a Game 7 in the Chapel Hill Regional against No. 5 North Carolina. No. 6 LSU and Little Rock will also play one more time Monday. After dominating Sunday night, No. 16 Southern Miss will face Miami one more time in the Hattiesburg Regional and No. 10 Ole Miss will face Murray State.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We've got you covered on everything from game times, score updates and what to expect going forward in this year's tournament.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><a name=\"regionals\"></a></p>\n\n\n<center>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Jump to:<br>\n<a href=\"#regionals\">Regionals schedule</a><br>\n<a href=\"#supers\">Super regionals matchups</a>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"#mcws\">MCWS</a></strong></p>\n</center>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Regionals</h2>\n<i>Double elimination<br>\nAll times ET; All games across ESPN Networks</i><br>\n<p><b>Nashville Regional (Nashville, Tennessee)</b></p>\n\n\n<p><b>Friday</b></p>\n<p>Game 1: Louisville 8, East Tennessee State 3<br>\nGame 2: No. 1 Vanderbilt 4, Wright State 3</p>\n<p><b>Saturday</b></p>\n<p>Game 3: Wright State 7, East Tennessee State 5 <em>-- E.

      "story": "<p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Despite their undefeated start to the season, the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d815e23c-aa3e-3490-d7be-f876d1e30e8a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-lynx\">Minnesota Lynx</a> are unsatisfied with what they've shown so far.</p>\n<p>\"That's the thing with expectations -- we have to do more because our goals are high,\" Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said following Minnesota's 86-75 win over the Valkyries on Sunday. \"We don't want to be pedestrian at anything we do. There are times in the game we go through stretches where we're just not intentional. We don't recognize how hard it is to win possession in this league and what it takes. Being more consistent in that mindset is what we're looking for.\"</p>\n<p>The Lynx took commanding control of Sunday's game in the third quarter, where they held Golden State to just eight points. Minnesota outscored the Valkyries 22-4 from midway of the third quarter to the middle of the fourth to push a one-point lead up to a 22 points.</p>\n<p>But up until that point, the two teams traded buckets throughout the first half.</p>\n<p>The Lynx point to their defense as the reason for the second-half turnaround -- getting in the Valkyries' space more, taking control of the pace and playing with better execution. But that attention to detail started in the locker room at halftime -- when the Lynx were trailing by one -- with an impassioned speech from Reeve.</p>\n<p>\"She was expressing her frustration with us,\" <a data-player-guid=\"3050c42f-4845-9e46-c003-1b0adb4c5e14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3917450/napheesa-collier\">Napheesa Collier</a> said. \"And honestly, it's really valid. The fact that we know what to do and we're not going out to do it, it's extremely frustrating... we need to go out there and take responsibility.\"</p>\n<p><photo1>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even before the game, Reeve reminded her team -- which was coming off of a narrow buzzer-beater win over the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"514d18a9-00a8-d52b-dda2-37d707f19bd0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-mercury\">Phoenix Mercury</a> -- that they needed to play with a high level of passion and effort.</p>\n<p>\"It's a matter of us locking in,\" <a data-player-guid=\"af31f6fd-c336-4832-e8bc-60604765de83\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2987891/courtney-williams\">Courtney Williams</a> said. \"We need to bring it every night. I think sometimes we take that for granted. We've got to stop doing that. If we want to accomplish the goals we have for ourselves, we can't be a second-half team.\"</p>\n<p>Collier finished with 24 points and 11 rebounds but didn't seem to fully find an offensive rhythm until the latter portion of the third quarter. Williams added 20 points in 26 minutes.</p>\n<p>Collier points to the third quarter against the Valkyries, as well as other spurts throughout the early season, as proof that Minnesota has what it takes to be a title contender -- their ultimate goal. Collier told ESPN that she feels their win over the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2da9bce5-382a-83d9-132c-b6c59d0e8eb9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/sea/seattle-storm\">Seattle Storm</a> was the only one she'd categorize as a \"good game\" for the Lynx.</p>\n<p>Despite a 7-0 record -- their best start since 2017 -- the mere flashes of excellence aren't enough for them to be comfortable,</p>\n<p>\"The aggressiveness and assertiveness that we come out with in certain games, we need to do that in every game,\" Collier said. \"We know we can. We have bigger goals this season than individual games. And yeah, it takes individual games to get there or we're not going to reach those bigger goals.\"</p>\n<p>She continued: \"It's really up to us. We are the only ones standing in our way, which is the good news. And hopefully, this is the last time we'll be talking about this.\"</p>\n\n"

He finally got to victory lane for his 14th career victory and first since Martinsville in November.</p>\n<p>\"I never gave up hope that's for sure,\" Blaney said. \"We've had great speed all year. It just hasn't really been the best year for us as far as good fortune. But [No.] 12 boys are awesome. They stick with it no matter how it goes.\"</p>\n<p>He became the ninth different winner this season and the fifth driver to win in as many races at Nashville. He also gave Team Penske a second straight Cup win at Nashville's 1.33-mile concrete track.</p>\n<p>Blaney, who started 15th, quickly drove his way to the front as he won the second stage. He easily held off <a data-player-guid=\"b8e51642-86cf-5bea-262f-d4600742cf98\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=5610\">Carson Hocevar</a> by 2.83 seconds. Hocevar matched his career-best finish at Atlanta in February after complaining during the race that his No. 77 Chevrolet was undriveable.</p>\n<p>\"Either I'm really dramatic or they're really good on adjustments,\" Hocevar said. \"Probably a little bit of both, but, yeah, proud of this group proud of this car. A place that is really, really difficult to pass, we're able to go 26th to second.\"</p>\n<p><photo1>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a data-player-guid=\"a58d119b-28b4-367c-2e41-e701bdbbd5ee\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=747\">Denny Hamlin</a> finished third in his 700th career Cup Series race, matching the third-place finish by <a data-player-guid=\"855fbfe3-ea39-a166-f6dc-df7eb50bc8da\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=67\">Jeff Gordon</a> at Darlington in 2013 for the best finish in a driver's 700th race. <a data-player-guid=\"a572bbd8-34ca-15b9-9142-ca8755f35ecc\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=4319\">Joey Logano</a>, who won here last year, was fourth and <a data-player-guid=\"49912ffd-2351-22c3-095e-15015170ff1c\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=4721\">William Byron</a> fifth.</p>\n<p>Hamlin was hoping for one more caution that never came after seven cautions for 35 laps.</p>\n<p>\"Just couldn't run with the 12 [Blaney] there in the super long run,\" Hamlin said. \"After 40 laps, I could maintain with him. But then after that, he just pulled away and stretched it on us.\"</p>\n<p>There was a sprint to the finish under green forcing teams and drivers to pick and choose when to pit. Blaney had led 107 laps when he went to the pits under green flag on lap 248. Hamlin took the lead before going to pit road on lap 256.</p>\n<p>Crew chief Jonathan Hassler said they decided on Blaney's fifth and final pit stop to try to make sure he could get back out into the cleanest air possible.</p>\n<p>\"It was really nice just to finish off a race,\" Hassler said.</p>\n<p><a data-player-guid=\"a0b3db6d-ef76-6936-e390-0f3a30d16d06\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=626\">Brad Keselowski</a> had the lead when he went to the pits on lap 269. Blaney took the lead for the final 31 laps.</p>\n<p><strong>Waiting on a call</strong></p>\n<p>Hamlin raced Sunday night hoping to take advantage of his starting spot spot beside pole-sitter <a data-player-guid=\"690794a4-08b0-0084-e269-09a566c869e5\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=4773\">Chase Briscoe</a>. Whether Hamlin would chase his third win this season had been in question with his third child, a boy, due the same day.</p>\n<p>Hamlin practiced and qualified well, so he drove his No. 11 Toyota even as Joe Gibbs Racing had <a data-player-guid=\"2bd74459-ef5e-14e7-9e60-ba5c3c35d7ff\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=4427\">Ryan Truex</a> on standby in case Hamlin got the call that his fiancee was in labor. Hamlin won the first stage and survived the final stretch without water or fresh air.</p>\n<p><a data-player-guid=\"2a3584f7-b1c1-9048-ff4b-b8a8cc6c1192\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=4577\">Tyler Reddick</a> beat his boss Hamlin, a co-owner of his 23XI Racing team, to new parent status, which Reddick announced on social media earlier Sunday.</p>\n<p>His family welcomed their second son at 2:20 a.m. on May 25, then Reddick followed up hours later by finishing 26th in the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte.</p>\n<p><strong>Early night</strong></p>\n<p>Ricky Stenhouse Jr. didn't finish his first race this year. He was the first out when Hocevar tapped his No. 47 Chevrolet, spinning Stenhouse into the wall between Turns 3 and 4 for the second caution of the race on lap 106.</p>\n<p><strong>Punishment and more penalties possible?</strong></p>\n<p><a data-player-guid=\"f14de48f-7caa-3436-029b-8fe2e73dd772\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=805\">AJ Allmendinger</a> started at the back of the field and served a stop-and-go penalty after the green flag for an unapproved adjustment to the splitter during Saturday's practice. His No. 16 Chevrolet was sent back to the garage and then the scanning station before practice and qualifying.</p>\n<p>The No. 66 Ford of <a data-player-guid=\"a1243f34-5da2-2065-b4cc-5f169d854b2a\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=2&driverId=4783\">Chad Finchum</a> failed inspection twice leading to engineer Austin Webb's ejection. The Garage 66 team also lost pit stall selection.</p>\n<p><strong>Up next </strong></p>\n<p>NASCAR heads to Michigan International Speedway for the Cup Series on June 8.</p>\n\n"
