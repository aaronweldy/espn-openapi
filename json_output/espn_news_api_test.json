      "story": "<video1><p><a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/virat-kohli-253802\">Virat Kohli</a> just didn't know what to do with himself. It had finally happened. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/josh-hazlewood-288284\">Josh Hazlewood</a> had bowled a dot ball on the second ball of the last over. Punjab Kings now needed 29 to win off the last four balls. He later suggested to <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/ab-de-villiers-44936\">AB de Villiers</a>, friend and former <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/team/royal-challengers-bengaluru-335970\">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</a> team-mate, with whom he put together many magical stands, that he was struggling to hold back tears. Now, though, it was mathematically impossible to lose if Hazlewood didn't concede extras. Kohli has faced enough of Hazlewood to know that wasn't going to happen.</p><p>It's funny. If you look back at any of RCB's interviews in the last week or so, you see signs of a team that believed this was their time. Their players signed off from New Chandigarh promising bigger celebrations on June 3. Kohli said that before the final he had told de Villiers that he wanted him to celebrate with them \"when\" they lifted the trophy at the end of the night.</p><p>And yet, when it does actually come around, you don't know what to do. As Kohli later said, he gave this team <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/virat-kohli-on-rcb-s-ipl-title-win-i-ve-given-this-team-everything-1488927\">his youth, his prime, his everything</a>, just for this moment. The team gave back. He came across players here who shaped his international career. Every year he dusted himself off and brought the same energy to the team. After the 2009 heartbreak, when he was just a kid. After 2016, when it seemed even more preordained than this year.</p><alsosee></p><p>You can trick your mind into believing there is no power that can stop you from winning, but when you have had that kind of history, you can't visualise what you will do after winning. On top of that, there are four balls to go before you can let yourself go completely.</p><p>At the end of the second ball, Kohli covered his face, and then covered even his eyes. The fingers came back wet. He had to wipe them on the back of his trousers. He was fielding at deep midwicket, one of the hot zones in the death overs that needs your best fielders. The next ball flew away for a six into the leg side. You have never seen Kohli react slower. He just jogged towards the ball and let someone from the infield retrieve it.</p><p>RCB coach <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2025-final-andy-flower-tremendous-respect-for-how-rajat-patidar-remained-calm-despite-scrutiny-1488979\">Andy Flower later acknowledged</a> that those who believe in fate would have a story to tell because geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan led to the suspension of <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924\">IPL 2025</a> just when Royal Challengers' campaign was flagging with injuries to Rajat Patidar and Hazlewood, which gave both players time to recover. Their opponents in the final, <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/wtc-final-bound-south-africa-players-set-to-miss-ipl-2025-playoffs-1485970\">PBKS, lost a key player</a> because the delay disrupted his team's WTC final preparations.</p><p>Try talking about fate to Kohli. He kept moving in circles as boundaries came off the last three balls. He looked deep into the stands. When you are struggling to hold back tears, looking into the distance helps. The same stands that mourned with him <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/india-vs-australia-final-1384439/full-scorecard\">on November 19 two years ago</a> were celebrating with him. A lot of them had come from Bengaluru. Not just English- and Kannada- and Dakhni-speaking fans, but also Tamil- and Hindi speakers who have settled in Bengaluru. The metro rides from Ahmedabad to Motera were jampacked and suffocating, but they endured it with discipline and joy. Perhaps they believe in fate.</p><p><inline2></p><p>The crowd for Qualifier 2 - on a Sunday - was only about half of this. Most of them were in the No. 18 knockoffs. Flight tickets from Bengaluru to Ahmedabad had risen to close to Rs 40,000 one way (over US$460). They still came. As they have been coming for 18 years. Never dunking on their team even when they were ridiculed for the team's performance.</p><p>One ball later, Kohli used the blue towel and threw it over the rope. It didn't matter if the ball was wet now. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/krunal-pandya-471342\">Krunal Pandya</a> began to celebrate after the fourth ball. He wouldn't know what Kohli was going through. This was Krunal's fourth title. His second Player of the Match in a final. He can't know the pain of waiting with the same side for 18 long years.</p><p>Kohli said there might have been moments of doubt in between, but he never seriously considered moving to any other franchise. He wanted to win his first IPL with RCB. Not many do, but he had found home at the first go. He gave his heart, soul, and now his experience to \"Bangalore\". This is where he went from wild child to lean, mean fighting machine to responsible statesman. At some point along the way, it became his forever home. No matter how much you trick yourself into believing you will win, when you are slowly winding down and retiring from one format after the other, surely there are times you wonder: what if you never win?</p><p>Before the last ball, Kohli threw away his cap as well. As the ball flew away for the final six, he sank to his knees with the grace of a Roger Federer icing one of his many Grand Slam wins when the opponent made an error. If there aren't any already, there will soon be split-screen edits showing both falling to their knees upon winning.</p><p><photo1><p>That it means enough to Kohli to bring him to tears is vindication of how important the IPL is and how utterly difficult winning it is. Kohli is someone who has won almost all there is to win in cricket. The IPL is still a young product. Not long ago, it started as a glorified holiday for overseas players. This tournament needed a buy-in from its big stars.</p><p>For 18 years, Kohli has given it his all, celebrating, anguishing, sledging, putting his reputation on the line beefing with kids, reinventing his game to triple the percentage of good-length balls he slogs. His tears of anguish, and now tears of joy, are perhaps the most glowing endorsement for the tournament.</p><p>Second only to the crowd. About three-fourths of the 92,000 people who turned up stayed back till the end of the bloated presentations that went on for nearly an hour and a half after the match ended. They all sounded like they had the night of their lives despite all the struggles of attending a match in India. People were on the phone telling their loved ones they were \"right there\" when \"we\" won. A lot of them were going to go straight to the airport or the train station because Ahmedabad just doesn't have enough hotels to accommodate everyone who comes to attend a match at the humongous stadium.</p><p>There were many chasing the team bus to the hotel. That RCB will get a much bigger celebration, most likely an open-top bus ride with the trophy, in Bengaluru is a matter of when more than if. By then, Kohli and the others will not be fumbling with their reactions. They will have slept like babies and woken up to confirm this is not just a dream. That they are the IPL champions.</p>"

After it was upgraded to a flagrant 1, Diggins made the free throw and Seattle retained possession, leading to Ezi Magbegor\u2019s basket for a 74-63 lead.\n\n\r\n              Magbegor\u2019s shot capped Seattle\u2019s 18-4 run as Dallas went without a field goal for five-plus minutes, missing eight straight shots.\n\n\r\n              Wheeler scored all 11 of her points in the second half, to go with seven assists, for Seattle (4-4). Diggins had just nine points to end her 22-game streak with at least 10 points \u2014 the third longest active streak in the league. The Storm got 30 points from their bench players.\n\n\r\n              DiJonai Carrington led Dallas (1-7) with 22 points. Myisha Hines-Allen had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and Maddy Siegrist added 11 and nine. Arike Ogunbowale was held to eight points on 4-of-15 shooting.\n\n\r\n              Luisa Geiselsoder made a wide open 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer to extend the Dallas lead to 38-30 at the break. \n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP WNBA: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball\">https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball</a>\n\n\r\n"

He was warming up for the fourth inning when he summoned an athletic trainer Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>\"It's not as bad (as what he felt in Atlanta) but it still grabbed,\" Greene said. \"It's not concerning, it's frustrating. I want to be out there and compete. I feel like as a pitcher, you do your best when you're in a groove and you're going out there every fifth or sixth day. It just makes it a little bit more difficult when you're trying to overcome some stuff.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Greene, who made his first All-Star appearance last season, is 4-3 with a 2.72 ERA in 11 starts this year.</p>\n<p>The 25-year-old right-hander allowed two runs and five hits with three walks and seven strikeouts in five innings against the Brewers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He faced 23 Milwaukee batters and threw first-pitch strikes to all of them. According to Sportradar, Greene is the second pitcher to have a 100% first-strike rate when facing 23 or more batters since tracking began in 2000. Detroit's Michael Fulmer went 23 of 23 against Minnesota in 2017.</p>\n<p>Only seven pitchers have had a first-pitch strike rate of at least 95%. Cincinnati's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33372/nick-martinez\">Nick Martinez</a> was 23 of 24 during a start against Atlanta last season.</p>\n<p>\"I wish I could have finished some guys a little bit more. I've faced these guys so many times,\" said Greene, who made his seventh start against the Brewers. \"I still made some really good pitches, and then they hit it. It's probably because they've seen it a million times, but that's the competitive part of the game and you've got to embrace that.\"</p>\n\n"

      "story": "<video1><p>The most remarkable thing about <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/team/punjab-kings-335973\">Punjab Kings</a>' (PBKS) run to the <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924\">IPL 2025</a> final was that they did so with hardly any international experience in their batting. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/shreyas-iyer-642519\">Shreyas Iyer</a> was the only capped Indian batter they had and even he is out of favour in two of the three international formats right now. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/josh-inglis-662235\">Josh Inglis</a>, who can perhaps consider himself an Australia regular now, played only 11 out of 17 matches. Glenn Maxwell played seven. Marcus Stoinis batted too low.</p><p>Throughout the season, this merry band of inexperienced and shackle-free Indian batters kept taking the game on even if it meant getting bowled out for 111 and 101. This approach came off even when they found themselves down at <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/punjab-kings-bat-without-brakes-to-equal-record-for-200-plus-totals-in-ipl-2025-1486390\">34 for 3 against Rajasthan Royals</a> (RR) on one occasion.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924/punjab-kings-vs-royal-challengers-bengaluru-final-1473511/full-scorecard\">the final</a>, though, probably for the first time all season, PBKS blinked. In overs three and four, they didn't try to make the play and found themselves at 32 for 0, only one more than their lowest four-over score all tournament. That brace of 31s was 31 because they had lost three wickets in the first four overs in those matches.</p><alsosee></p><p>Here, in the big final, PBKS' inexperienced openers were playing in a way that wasn't true to their game. Part of it was not because it was the final. It was actually smart, their coach <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/ricky-ponting-7133\">Ricky Ponting</a> said later. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/team/royal-challengers-bengaluru-335970\">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</a> (RCB) bowled <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/josh-hazlewood-288284\">Josh Hazlewood</a> in the first three overs for only the fourth time this IPL. The openers probably decided RCB were looking for an early wicket. They also recognised that Hazlewood had done against them in previous matches, and were circumspect.</p><p>It was the over after, bowled by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, that Ponting felt could have been attacked. Just four runs came off that over as the openers, <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/priyansh-arya-1175456\">Priyansh Arya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/prabhsimran-singh-1161024\">Prabhsimran Singh</a>, played to the merit of the ball instead of playing their natural attacking game. \"You know, when you have a really good defensive over, it's really important that the next one you go after and try and capitalise on,\" Ponting said. \"And we weren't able to do that in the fourth over of that powerplay.\"</p><p><inline2></p><p>After that, PBKS were always chasing the game against RCB's well-rounded attack. Asked if this circumspection was a reaction to their 101 all out against the same team in Qualifier 1, Ponting said, \"I would like to think not because one thing I've told this group is always taking the game forward, always seeing the positive result and the way that we go about it, and not thinking about the negative result that might happen if you get out.</p><p>\"One thing as a batsman in this game, you can't be worried about getting out. If you're worried about getting out, you can't play the game well.\"</p><p>It just made Phil Salt's catch of Arya much more significant - he ran about 20 yards to his right and along the boundary, took the catch, lobbed the ball up before stepping out, and came back in to complete the catch.</p><p><photo1><p>Even if it was the lack of experience that might have cost PBKS the final, Ponting promised similarly competitive and aggressive cricket from his players, who will be more experienced come next season. \"I can't speak highly enough for what those young boys have done through the tournament,\" Ponting said. \"I think I talked at the first press conference I had with Shreyas about becoming a daring, dynamic, and different team.</p><p>\"On the back of that, what Prabh and Priyansh and [Nehal] Wadhera and these sort of guys were able to do, there's probably enough been said through the media over the last couple of months. The way that we've been able to play our cricket, it's been highly entertaining. For a coach to be able to sit back and say that about a team gives me a lot of satisfaction.</p><p>\"You can probably look at it tonight and say, 'was it probably a little bit of inexperience that cost us?' Maybe a little bit of experience in that middle order today might have helped us out, but what I know is that we're going to have these younger guys around this team for a long time and I think they're going to win us a lot of games going forward.\"</p><p>Ponting did feel, though, that PBKS let this one slip after keeping RCB down to 190. \"We've got it right for most of the year,\" Ponting said. \"It was only a couple of days ago that we were here celebrating <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2025-1449924/mumbai-indians-vs-punjab-kings-qualifier-2-1473510/full-scorecard\">one of our great wins</a> for the season to get into the final, and today we probably feel that we've let one slip, but as I said, with this group being as young as it is, we'll be back bigger and stronger next season.\"</p>"
