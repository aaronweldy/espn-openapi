Murphy added that Woodruff would undergo a CT scan on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The incident could cause one more delay in Woodruff's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/43818408/brewers-brandon-woodruff-eager-take-next-step-comeback\">long-awaited return</a> to the majors.

      "story": "TAMPA, Fla. -- \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42584/drew-rasmussen\">Drew Rasmussen</a> extended his MLB-leading scoreless streak to 23 innings with five innings of one-hit ball and the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a> beat the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a> 5-1 on Tuesday night.\n\n\r\n              Rasmussen (5-4) allowed only a single to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39882/jake-burger\">Jake Burger</a> in the third inning and struck out eight in a game that was delayed for less that 20 minutes due to rain in the third in front of an announced crowd of 9,131 at George M. Steinbrenner Field.\n\n\r\n              <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42416/kameron-misner\">Kameron Misner</a> put Tampa Bay on the board with a solo homer in the second inning. In the sixth inning, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33481/yandy-diaz\">Yandy Diaz</a> scored on a wild pitch by the Rangers' <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/3210625/jacob-latz\">Jacob Latz</a>. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40810/jonathan-aranda\">Jonathan Aranda</a> scored on an infield single by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42664/jake-mangum\">Jake Mangum</a> before <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4905921/junior-caminero\">Junior Caminero</a> stole home when Misner struck out looking. \n\n\r\n              Caminero homered in the eighth, his fifth long ball in the last six games, to complete the scoring for Tampa Bay.\n\n\r\n              Burger had two of Texas' four hits, including an RBI single in the seventh inning.\n\n\r\n              <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34973/tyler-mahle\">Tyler Mahle</a> (5-3) allowed five hits, four earned runs and three walks in 5 1/3 innings, striking out five.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key moment</hl2>\r\n              With runners on the corners and one out in the sixth, Caminero raced home on a steal. The Rays\u2019 third baseman instinctively took off for home when Rangers catcher <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30545/kyle-higashioka\">Kyle Higashioka</a> released a throw to catch Jake Mangum stealing second. Because Caminero took off before Higashioka\u2019s throw passed shortstop <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32691/corey-seager\">Corey Seager</a>, he was credited with the rare steal of home.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key stat</hl2>\r\n              Rasmussen has not allowed a run over his last four starts, dating to May 17. In that span, Rasmussen has struck out 21, walked three and allowed 10 hits. It was the 14th straight game in which a Rays starter allowed three runs or fewer.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Up next</hl2>\r\n              Texas RHP Kumar Rocker (1-3, 8.10 ERA) is expected to come off the injured list and make his ninth MLB start. Tampa Bay RHP <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39639/shane-baz\">Shane Baz</a> (4-3, 4.92 ERA) has allowed two homers in three of his last four games.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP MLB: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\">https://apnews.com/hub/mlb</a>"

But it allowed Neto to score to put the Angels in front.\n\n\r\n              <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4987382/ceddanne-rafaela\">Ceddanne Rafaela</a> had two RBI for Boston. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41610/jarren-duran\">Jarren Duran</a> also had an RBI.\n\n\r\n              Los Angeles starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41415/yusei-kikuchi\">Yusei Kikuchi</a> pitched five innings plus three batters, allowing three runs off eight hits with five walks. He also struck out five, including his 900th major league strikeout.\n\n\r\n              Boston\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4720856/brayan-bello\">Brayan Bello</a> ended a five-game streak of not making it through at least five innings. He lasted six innings, allowing three runs off seven hits. \n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key moment</hl2>\r\n              With Boston trailing 3-1 in the sixth, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32150/trevor-story\">Trevor Story</a> led off with a walk. Rafaela then jumped on Kikuchi\u2019s 89 mph slider, driving it 426 feet over the Green Monster for his fifth homer of the season. It was Kikuchi\u2019s final hitter of the night.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key stat</hl2>\r\n              Boston drops to 6-17 in one-run games this season. \n\n\r\n              <hl2>Up next</hl2>\r\n              Angels RHP Jos\u00e9 Soriano (4-5, 3.41 ERA) faces Red Sox RHP <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32697/lucas-giolito\">Lucas Giolito</a> (1-1, 4.78) in the series finale.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP MLB: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\">https://apnews.com/hub/MLB</a>"

      "story": "CHICAGO -- \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5201814/shane-smith\">Shane Smith</a> pitched three-hit ball into the sixth inning, and the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a> beat the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers\">Detroit Tigers</a> 8-1 on Tuesday night to stop a four-game slide.\n\n\r\n              Michael A. Taylor homered and drove in four runs for Chicago, which had dropped seven of eight overall. Smith (2-3) struck out six in 5 1/3 scoreless innings for his first win since April 24.\n\n\r\n              It was the first home win for the White Sox against the Tigers since June 4, 2023. They had lost a franchise-record 11 straight home games versus Detroit.\n\n\r\n              <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4345620/dillon-dingler\">Dillon Dingler</a> hit an RBI double in the seventh to account for the Tigers' only run. The AL Central leaders had won seven of eight, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tigers-white-sox-score-26835f3e79be8662f57a2c610a2e0fc4\">a 13-1 victory</a> in the series opener.\n\n\r\n              Taylor started in center field in place of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/white-sox-luis-robert-mlb-a95de8426d13ae061783e2b2118d7562\"><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39631/luis-robert-jr\">Luis Robert Jr</a>.</a>, who is making some adjustments at the plate and got the day off.\n\n\r\n              Chicago opened a 4-0 lead when Taylor hit a three-run drive off <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/3983833/tyler-holton\">Tyler Holton</a> with two out in the sixth. It was his third homer of the season.\n\n\r\n              <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35265/austin-slater\">Austin Slater</a> tacked on a two-run double in the seventh against <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4414123/dylan-smith\">Dylan Smith</a> on a bullpen day for Detroit.\n\n\r\n              The Tigers went 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position and stranded nine overall.\n\n\r\n              Chicago jumped in front in the fourth. Brenan Hanifee replaced <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5197093/brant-hurter\">Brant Hurter</a> (2-1) and committed a throwing error to help set up Taylor's bases-loaded walk.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key moment</hl2>\r\n              The Tigers loaded the bases with one out in the eighth, but Wenceel P\u00e9rez struck out swinging against <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4228247/brandon-eisert\">Brandon Eisert</a> before Dingler lined out to right.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Key stat</hl2>\r\n              The White Sox improved to 3-15 against the AL Central this season. They went 10-42 against the division last year.\n\n\r\n              <hl2>Up next</hl2>\r\n              Tigers right-hander <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4087614/sawyer-gipson-long\">Sawyer Gipson-Long</a> is expected to make his season debut on Wednesday. He is coming back from elbow and hip surgeries. The White Sox are going with a bullpen day.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP MLB: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\">https://apnews.com/hub/mlb</a>"
