As the parade started, the atmosphere was calm as fans stood behind barriers with a long line of riot police in front of them.</p>\n<p>They roared when the bus came into sight and captain <a data-player-guid=\"486c975c-4d32-255f-1aa8-6a879631ea48\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/297070/marquinhos\">Marquinhos</a> brandished the trophy over his head, then passed it down to other players, some of whom wore sunglasses.</p>\n<p>Coach Luis Enrique joined in with the fans as they sang one of the club's anthems, and star forward <a data-player-guid=\"5c936c66-707c-6b18-bbef-6214d951771d\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/229744/ousmane-dembele\">Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9</a> blew kisses. The team later met with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>\n<p>The overnight fatalities marred a night of exuberance after PSG clinched its first -- and long-awaited -- Champions League title. The Eiffel Tower glowed in team colors, and fans partied through the night.</p>\n<p>The team denounced the violence. The title \"should be a moment of collective joy,\" PSG said in a statement. \"These isolated acts are contrary to the club's values, and don't at all represent the immense majority of our fans.\"</p>\n<p>The overnight celebrations were largely peaceful but degenerated into violence in some areas.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in the western city of Dax during a PSG street party after Saturday night's final in Munich, the national police service said. The regional prosecutor said the killing was not apparently linked to the football match. In Paris, a man in his 20s was killed in Paris when his scooter was hit by a car during PSG celebrations, and the driver has been detained, Paris police said. The circumstances of both are being investigated.</p>\n<p>A police officer was hit accidentally by fireworks at a PSG gathering in Coutances in northwest France and placed in an artificial coma because of grave eye injuries, the national police service said. A total of 201 people were injured around the capital, four of them seriously, the Paris police chief said.</p>\n<p>In the Alpine city of Grenoble, a driver ran into pedestrians who had gathered for a PSG celebration, injuring three or four people, the regional prosecutor's office said. It said the driver was detained. The city also saw fans throwing projectiles at firefighters and police using dispersion grenades.</p>\n<p>Light show The team and French officials are hoping Sunday is about the victory instead of violence. Up to 110,000 people were allowed along the iconic, tree-lined Champs-Elysees avenue for a parade. Later, the team will join fans in PSG's home stadium, the Parc des Princes, for a concert and light show and official presentation of the Champions League trophy.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>A wide swath of central Paris was closed to traffic for the exceptional day. The security measures are also impacting the French Open unfolding nearby.</p>\n<p>Thousands of police were deployed to keep order, and will employ similar tactics as they did Saturday night, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told reporters. AP reporters saw tear gas used near the stadium and water cannons used near the Arc de Triomphe to disperse rowdy crowds Saturday.</p>\n<p>In addition to the injuries and arrests, Nunez said four stores were looted overnight. Firefighters were so busy extinguishing garbage can fires in the middle of celebrations and dealing with other emergencies that the fire hotline was overloaded.</p>\n<p>By 2 a.m. Sunday, a total of 294 arrests had been made, including 30 people who broke into a shoe shop on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Two cars were set alight close to Parc des Princes, police added.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>At the Place de la Bastille, there were joyous scenes as fans climbed onto the base of the famous column, singing, dancing and letting off flares, while those around them joined in.</p>\n<p>At one point, motorbikes loudly revved their engines and the crowd cheered as they did laps around the column. There were no police nearby and, the atmosphere was upbeat with no tensions and plenty of singing.</p>\n<p>Nunez blamed the scattered troubles on \"thousands of people who came to commit acts of violence\" instead of watching the match. He noted similar unrest on the sidelines of prior celebrations in the capital, such as after France's World Cup win in 2018.</p>\n<p>Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau lamented the violence, saying, \"I am angry today, like many French people ... When parents panic because their child has gone out to celebrate a major sports victory, that's unbearable.\"</p>\n"

He is hitting .208 overall, with seven homers and a team-high 27 RBIs for a Rangers club that has struggled offensively. He ranked 14th in the majors with 122 home runs over the past four seasons.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Garc\u00eda, who has started 55 of Texas' 60 games in right field this season, missed only one other game before this weekend, with manager Bruce Bochy saying Friday that Garc\u00eda was being given a mental break.</p>\n<p>\"It's about the mental reset and coming back with more energy,\" Garc\u00eda told reporters Saturday. \"I'm working on some stuff without the pressure of having to do something up there.\"</p>\n<p>Garc\u00eda, 32, is in the final season of a two-year contract.</p>\n<p>The anticipated return of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4917921/evan-carter\">Evan Carter</a> to the active roster Tuesday, joining <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719324/wyatt-langford\">Wyatt Langford</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4916547/alejandro-osuna\">Alejandro Osuna</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38347/sam-haggerty\">Sam Haggerty</a>, further crowds the Rangers outfield as Garc\u00eda tries to return to the lineup.</p>\n<p>\"It's going to be performance-driven at this point,\" Young said.</p>\n<p>Texas also made three roster moves before Sunday's game. Right-hander <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31174/nathan-eovaldi\">Nathan Eovaldi</a> (triceps fatigue) was placed on the 15-day injured list retroactive to Thursday, catcher <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31173/tucker-barnhart\">Tucker Barnhart</a> was designated for assignment, and right-hander Codi Heuer was selected from Triple-A Round Rock.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"

He went 1-2 with an 8.84 ERA in seven starts at Triple-A Louisville this season.</p>\n<p>Cincinnati had until Sunday to make a decision on Miley, who is looking for a starting opportunity. The Reds could have brought him up and put him in their bullpen.</p>\n<p>Reds manager Terry Francona praised president of baseball operations Nick Krall for giving Miley a chance to look around.</p>\n<p>\"To throw him in the bullpen to try to keep (him) -- because if we have something happen, it's not good -- but it's not necessarily entirely fair to him, I just appreciate the way Nick handled it with him,\" Francona said.</p>\n<p>Miley, an All-Star with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"43e14a76-ff66-49ed-24fc-2835932f99dd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona</a> in 2012, is 108-99 with a 4.07 ERA in 310 starts and seven relief appearances over 14 major league seasons.

The 31-year-old Candelario is coming back from a lower-back injury.</p>\n<p>Candelario will play in some games in Arizona before moving his rehab to Louisville.</p>\n<p>\"It just seems like it helps him to be in a more controlled environment out in Arizona where they can see some pitches and then when they've got some under their belt, then they can go to Triple-A,\" Francona said before Sunday's series finale against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a>.</p>\n<p>Candelario is batting just .113 (9 for 80) with two homers and 10 RBIs in 22 games.

He also had to withdraw from the Italian race in 2020 and 2022 - because of coronavirus and a knee injury, respectively.</p>\n<p>\"I'm still in shock of what I've done,\" Yates said. \"It's something that I've been working toward for a long time.\"</p>\n<p>Yates, who rides for Team Visma Lease a Bike, finished 3 minutes, 56 seconds ahead of Del Toro and 4:43 ahead of Richard Carapaz, the 2019 champion from Ecuador.</p>\n<p>Dutch rider Olav Kooij, Yates' teammate, won the final stage in a sprint finish. It was his second victory in this Giro after also winning the 12th stage.</p>\n<p>During the non-competitive neutralized period just before the mostly ceremonial final stage actually began, the peloton passed through the Vatican and was blessed by Pope Leo XIV.</p>\n<p>The 143-kilometer (89-mile) final stage concluded with a circuit of eight laps through downtown Rome and finished next to the Circus Maximus.</p>\n<p>Yates, 32, already acknowledged that this victory is \"the peak\" of his career. His best finish in the Tour de France was fourth in 2023.</p>\n<p>His twin brother Adam rode for UAE Team Emirates as a support rider for Del Toro -- so was competing against his brother. But the brothers posed arm-in-arm for photos together during the final stage.</p>\n<p>Del Toro, despite his tactical mistakes on Saturday, finished with the white jersey for the top young rider. This was just his second Grand Tour after placing 36th in the Vuelta last year.</p>\n<p>\"I'm learning,\" Del Toro said. \"I should be happy with myself.\"</p>\n<p>Danish rider Mads Pedersen took the maroon jersey for points after winning four stages.</p>\n<p>Lorenzo Fortunato of Italy took the blue jersey for the mountain classification.</p>\n\n"

He has appeared in 24 games with a 3.47 ERA over 23\u2153 innings.</p>\n<p>A third-round pick of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a> in 2019, Slaten is in his second season with the Red Sox. A year ago, he went 6-2 with a 2.93 ERA and 58 strikeouts over 44 appearances.</p>\n<p>He's been less dominant in 2025 and has cited fatigue as a reason for the dip.</p>\n<p>Guerrero, 24, has been stellar in limited major league action over two seasons, posting a sparkling 0.59 ERA over 15\u2153 innings (13 appearances).</p>\n<p>Overall, Guerrero is 14-12 with a 3.11 ERA in 133 minor league appearances.</p>\n<p>Eaton, who plays the outfield and third base, was a 21st-round 2018 draft pick of the Royals. He has 159 major league at-bats, hitting .201. The 28-year-old last appeared in the majors for Kansas City in 2023.</p>\n<p>Sogard, 27, hit .245 for Boston this year in 14 games (49 at-bats).</p>\n<p>Sabol, 27, has an even smaller sample size this year than Sogard (eight games, 16 at-bats), but has had limited success, batting .125.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"
