But as a passer, Young is a fast processor who has rare poise. The game slows down for him, and he never seems to panic. He is sudden and tough in the pocket, with quick feet and a swift release. Young displays very good ball placement on the perimeter at all three levels, and he showcases excellent touch and knows how to lead receivers into yards after the catch. He does need to improve the consistency of his accuracy on anticipation throws over the middle of the field. But Young shows great overall operational poise, and no moment is too big for him. He's a pocket passer first, but he has the mobility to frequently extend plays and generate production with his feet. <i>-- Final evaluation</i>"

New coordinator Thomas Brown comes from a Rams scheme that uses shifts and motions to create confusion, and Young's accuracy, decision-making and poise should translate well here. He could be the long-term answer for the Panthers, who completed just 58.4% of their passes and finished 31st in Total QBR at 27.6 last season. <i>-- Jordan Reid</i><br><br><b>Projected Year 1 impact:</b> Rookie of the Year candidate.
