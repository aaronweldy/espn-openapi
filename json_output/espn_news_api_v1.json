After months of debates about different bracket structures and conferences getting multiple automatic bids, the conversation seems to have returned to a clean and easy bracket.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>We're going to pretend this means people are listening to me. When I wrote about this <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/44082762/how-handle-college-football-playoff-expansion-right-way\">debate in March</a>, I recommended skipping expansion to 14 teams and moving to 16, and I mocked the idea of multiple auto-bids. Granted, I also recommended putting six conference champions in the field and putting quarterfinal games in home stadiums, not just first-round games. I won't hold my breath on those ideas (especially the former), but that's still a pretty good batting average.</p>\n<p>After a week of posturing from power-conference leaders, let's keep the conversation going. Here are some thoughts about what we've learned this week and the debates still to come</p>\n\n\n<h2>Moving to nine conference games might cost the SEC one to two playoff teams per year</h2>\n\n\n<p>SEC commissioner Greg Sankey talked a lot this week. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/45366100\">He went on</a> \"The Paul Finebaum Show.\" He talked about a scheduling partnership <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45362616/lsu-brian-kelly-says-sec-coaches-want-game-vs-big-ten\">with the Big Ten</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45380660/sec-increases-fines-500k-rushing-field-court\">increased the fines</a> for field rushing. He talked about which playoff games should or will be <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45366353/sec-sankey-lot-factors-support-including-bowls-cfp\">on home campuses</a>. He talked about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45350954/greg-sankey-talks-sec-coaches-16-team-playoff-model-notes-problematic-timing\">how long this formatting process</a> takes. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45393051/big-ten-sec-support-all-football-big-12-commish-says\">He scoffed</a> at being told to serve the good of the game. And he spent a long time telling everyone <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45380276/cfp-5+11-model-gaining-traction-leaders-eye-next-steps\">how hard the SEC's schedules are</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>On Thursday afternoon, the SEC provided members of the media with a six-page packet that included color-coded charts using multiple metrics to illustrate the league's dominant schedule strength. Sankey said the task for determining the CFP's strength of schedule component is striking a balance \"between human and machine,\" referring to the old BCS computer formula. ... [The packet] included ESPN's Strength of Record, Bill Connelly's SP+, Kenneth Massey's metric, ESPN's Football Power Index and ESPN's Strength of Schedule metric.</blockquote>\n<p>Sankey seemed to have two primary goals for bringing up strength of schedule. For starters, it seemed as if he wanted to remind everyone that Alabama and its 9-3 record didn't get into last year's 12-team CFP despite strength-of-schedule numbers quite a bit stronger than those of higher-ranked teams such as SMU (which had gone 11-2), Boise State (12-1) and Indiana (11-1). He said that decision left him with critical questions about the committee and its process.</p>\n<p>\"I do think there's a need for change,\" Sankey said of the ranking protocol Thursday at the conclusion of his league's spring meetings. \"... How do you make those decisions? It's hard, and we trust the committee to do that, and I respect the people in there, so this isn't a criticism of the people. This is wanting to understand the decisions. We have to have better clarity on the criteria that inform those decisions.\"</p>\n<p>Now, all the strength-of-schedule advantages in the world didn't stop Alabama from losing to 6-6 Vanderbilt and 6-6 Oklahoma. In the latter game, Alabama couldn't have looked less playoff-worthy, losing 24-3 to the Sooners. Maybe the Tide would have gotten in with a formula approach, but they showed no indication that they could make a playoff run at the end of the season. Plus, we know that the playoff committee took Alabama's strength of schedule into account because it ranked the Tide ahead of 11-2 Arizona State, 10-2 Miami and 10-2 BYU, among others, despite how they looked at the end of the regular season. If Bama had lost to only\u00A0<i>one</i> of Vandy or Oklahoma, the Tide would have almost certainly been in the field of 12. And they definitely would've been in a field of 16 regardless, along with two other three-loss SEC teams (Ole Miss and South Carolina).</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p>Also, Sankey didn't mention that the committee had placed a one-loss Alabama team ahead of an unbeaten Florida State team in the CFP rankings just one year earlier. If we want to talk about a formula, let's talk about a formula. But the SEC has been treated with extreme kindness by the committee on average.</p>\n<p>(For the record, I'm all for a formula-based rankings system. I put out a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/insider/story/_/id/42348637/college-football-playoff-2024-conference-races-week-12\">BCS-like formula ranking</a> in the homestretch of each season, and there's value in the approach. People convinced themselves that they hated the BCS formula, but I will forever insist that the main reason they hated the formula wasn't the formula -- it was that the BCS selected only two teams to play for the title. With a lot more teams to choose now, a formula approach would work quite well.)</p>\n<p>Beyond the attempts to work the referees, however, Sankey also discussed schedule strength as it pertained to the ongoing conversation about the length of the SEC's conference schedules. The SEC plays eight-game conference schedules, while the other primary power conference, the Big Ten, plays nine-game schedules. Despite this difference, the metrics cited by the SEC above (including, yes, my SP+ rankings) are a pretty stark reminder that, between the SEC typically having far fewer easy matchups than the Big Ten and a solid rotation of annual out-of-conference rivalry games played by SEC teams against ACC programs -- Florida against Florida State, South Carolina against Clemson, etc. -- the average SEC schedule is already a decent amount tougher than the average Big Ten schedule. Using my recent <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45254341/spring-update-2025-college-football-sp+-rankings-every-fbs-team\">post-spring SP+ projections</a> as a guide, SEC teams project to have 13 of the 15 hardest schedules in the country despite eight-game conference slates.</p>\n<p>Since Sankey serves at the discretion of SEC presidents and, to a degree, athletic directors, it made sense that he wanted to push back on the mounting pressure to move to nine games.</p>\n<p>\"If we're not confident that the decision-making about who gets in and why and what are the metrics around it, it's going to be really hard for some of my colleagues to get to the nine games,\" Texas A&M athletics director Trev Alberts said this week.</p>\n<p>Why make your schedules harder if it will cost your conference playoff bids, right?</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>There are plenty of valid reasons for moving to nine games regardless of what it does to playoff status. For starters, it will likely increase the value of the SEC's media rights contract, giving the league even more of a war chest. It would make teams' home schedules even more exciting and, potentially, expensive. And most importantly, it would make the 16-team conference feel like an actual <i>conference</i>: With a nine-game schedule, you can play every team twice in four years. With eight-game schedules, those rotations take a lot longer. (Yes, this is being written by a Mizzou guy who's bitter that LSU fans, with their tailgating prowess, have had a reason to come to Columbia only once in Mizzou's 13 SEC seasons.)</p>\n<p>Because we're using numbers to prove that SEC schedules are already difficult, let's use numbers to ask a different question: How much more difficult <i>would</i> nine-game SEC schedules be?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, I did what I do: I ran a simulation. I created four years' worth of nine-game SEC schedules based around the super-clean, super-easy idea of permanent conference rivalries: You assign every team three permanent, annual opponents, and they play six other opponents home-and-away over two years, then the other six over the next two. Voila, you've visited every stadium in your conference and hosted every conference mate at least once every four years. I've been floored that other huge conferences such as the Big Ten and Big 12 haven't leaned further into the permanent rivals concept -- the 16-team Big 12 isn't making Farmageddon (Kansas State-Iowa State) an annual game, and the 18-team Big Ten didn't set up annual games between all of its four new Western teams. Regardless, I set up permanent rivals for each SEC team.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alabama</strong>: Auburn, LSU, Tennessee</li>\n<li><strong>Arkansas</strong>: Missouri, Texas, Texas A&M</li>\n<li><strong>Auburn</strong>: Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi State</li>\n<li><strong>Florida</strong>: Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina</li>\n<li><strong>Georgia</strong>: Auburn, Florida, South Carolina</li>\n<li><strong>Kentucky</strong>: Florida, Tennessee, Vanderbilt</li>\n<li><strong>LSU</strong>: Alabama, Mississippi State, Ole Miss</li>\n<li><strong>Mississippi State</strong>: Auburn, LSU, Ole Miss</li>\n<li><strong>Missouri</strong>: Arkansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina</li>\n<li><strong>Oklahoma</strong>: Missouri, Texas, Texas A&M</li>\n<li><strong>Ole Miss</strong>: LSU, Mississippi State, Vanderbilt</li>\n<li><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Florida, Georgia, Missouri</li>\n<li><strong>Tennessee</strong>: Alabama, Kentucky, Vanderbilt</li>\n<li><strong>Texas</strong>: Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas A&M</li>\n<li><strong>Texas A&M</strong>: Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas</li>\n<li><strong>Vanderbilt</strong>: Kentucky, Ole Miss, Tennessee</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These pairings preserve all but one of the series that have been played 90-plus times (Alabama-Mississippi State is the one I couldn't squeeze in, in part because MSU has four such series). They reconnect former Big 8, Big 12 and/or SWC rivalries such as Oklahoma-Missouri and Texas-Arkansas, but they don't go too far in that regard -- at this point, Missouri has played South Carolina as conference mates as many times as Texas A&M (13) and more than Texas (nine), and the teams from the two Columbias have played some strange and memorable battles already.</p>\n<p>There's obviously a pretty big difference in quality between, say, Auburn's or LSU's annual opponents versus those of Kentucky or Ole Miss. But remember: Six of a team's nine conference games come from the rest of the pool. Over a four-year rotation, Auburn's schedules are only a smidgen harder than Ole Miss' on average.</p>\n<p>A full nine-game Auburn schedule might look like this: Alabama, at Georgia, Mississippi State, at Oklahoma, South Carolina, at Ole Miss, Tennessee, at Vanderbilt, Texas A&M. Meanwhile, an Ole Miss schedule might look like this (common opponents in bold): at LSU, <strong>Vanderbilt, at Mississippi State</strong>, Arkansas, at Kentucky, Auburn, at Missouri, <strong>Georgia, at Oklahoma</strong>. One plays Alabama, the other plays LSU. One plays Kentucky, the other plays South Carolina. Over time, the schedule strengths will be pretty close.</p>\n<p>Using existing nonconference games as much as possible (with a few necessary tweaks), here's what the 2026 schedule might look like with nine total conference games and a 3+6 approach.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>Because you've got some teams now playing five conference road games, it will be difficult to avoid handing teams some pretty rough patches -- Alabama and Missouri playing four road games in five weeks late in the season, for example, or Kentucky starting with back-to-back conference road games. But it's hard not to notice how every week is pretty loaded. Some hypothetical 2026 headliners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Week 1</strong>: Georgia at Ole Miss, Clemson at LSU, Miami at South Carolina, Texas A&M at Tennessee</li>\n<li><strong>Week 2</strong>: Ohio State at Texas, Oklahoma at Michigan, Missouri at Kansas, Kentucky at LSU</li>\n<li><strong>Week 3</strong>: Florida State at Alabama, Oklahoma at Texas A&M, South Carolina at Auburn, Florida at Kentucky</li>\n<li><strong>Week 4</strong>: Tennessee at Georgia, Alabama at Florida, Arkansas vs. Texas A&M, LSU at South Carolina, Illinois at Missouri*</li>\n<li><strong>Week 5</strong>: Georgia at Alabama, Auburn at Oklahoma, Florida at Texas, Texas A&M at South Carolina, Ole Miss at Missouri</li>\n<li><strong>Week 6</strong>: Oklahoma vs. Texas, Tennessee at Auburn, Missouri at Georgia, South Carolina at Florida</li>\n<li><strong>Week 7</strong>: Tennessee at Alabama, LSU at Texas, Auburn at Ole Miss, Oklahoma at Arkansas, Georgia at South Carolina</li>\n<li><strong>Week 8</strong>: Arkansas at Ole Miss, Missouri at South Carolina, Oklahoma at Kentucky</li>\n<li><strong>Week 9</strong>: Alabama at Texas, Georgia vs. Florida, Ole Miss at LSU, Missouri at Texas A&M</li>\n<li><strong>Week 10</strong>: Alabama at LSU, Texas A&M at Auburn, Ole Miss at Oklahoma, Texas at Missouri</li>\n<li><strong>Week 11</strong>: Auburn at Georgia, Texas at Arkansas, Florida at Texas A&M, Missouri at Tennessee</li>\n<li><strong>Week 12</strong>: LSU at Florida, Georgia at Texas A&M, Missouri at Oklahoma, Alabama at South Carolina</li>\n<li><strong>Week 13</strong>: The typical loaded rivalry week</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(* Missouri is somehow scheduled to play at Illinois and Kansas in 2026, but because the Tigers drew a slate with five conference road games, I flipped the Illinois game out of pure convenience.)</p>\n<p>Obviously, the real-life 2026 SEC slate will also feature a lot of these big-time games, but aside from a relatively paltry Week 8, every week has some huge, TV-friendly brand matchups. That's an utterly loaded schedule.</p>\n<p>It's also a schedule that will, as athletic directors will surely notice, hand quite a few losses to good teams.</p>\n<p><video3></p>\n<p>Though I shared hypothetical 2026 schedules above, I wanted to use SP+ projections to look at a full four-year rotation and compare what it would produce from a wins-and-losses standpoint to what the current eight-game slate produces.</p>\n<p>For the league's elite teams, moving to nine games won't make much of a difference. For instance, with Georgia's current schedule, SP+ projects it to win 9.8 games on average, with an 84.9% chance of going at least 9-3 (the hypothetical cutoff line for SEC teams hoping to get into the field). But with an abridged, three-game nonconference schedule -- for the most part, I shrank nonconference schedules by getting rid of teams' second games against Group of 5 teams and leaving one game against a power-conference opponent, one against a G5 team and one against an FCS team -- Georgia averages 9.7 wins over four simulated seasons, with a 79.6% chance of reaching 9-3 or better on average. There's a bit less margin for error, but well-projected teams like Georgia will be in good shape, regardless.</p>\n<p>For the league's light heavyweights, however, things get trickier. Florida has a 43.7% chance of finishing 9-3 or better in 2025, but in a nine-SEC-games universe, that drops to 19.6%. Four others see their odds drop by at least 10%, and current long shots like Vanderbilt (10.2% chance of going 9-3 in 2025) see their odds almost completely vanish (0.1%).</p>\n<p>Overall, an average of 6.2 SEC teams are projected to go 9-3 or better in 2025. In a nine-game universe, that average shrinks to 4.7. With a 16-team field, you could say that the league would go from expecting around six teams in the field to having four or five teams safely in and campaigning for some 8-4 teams. Meanwhile, the league would also go from an average of 13.4 bowl-eligible teams to just 11.4.</p>\n<p>That's not an insignificant change. There would be plenty of cases where an 8-4 team with an off-the-charts strength of schedule would also be in good shape, but the professed risk is real. Of course, <i>that's what the money is for</i>. Media rights revenue would probably rise with expanded conference schedules; plus, the SEC and Big Ten are already guaranteed a huge portion of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/39738204/an-expanded-college-football-playoff-save-college-sports-not-greedy-imbalanced-era\">future CFP money anyway</a>, so if they lose a playoff team here or there, it's going to hurt only so much. Still, it's easy to see why SEC ADs and coaches, whose jobs (and, potentially, bonuses) might be dictated by CFP bids, might balk at making tough schedules tougher.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The SEC and Big Ten championship games are being rendered moot</h2>\n\n\n<p>Among the main reasons the Big Ten, in particular, was interested in a selection process that featured multiple auto-bids (a rumored four each for the Big Ten and SEC) was that it would allow the two conferences -- plus, perhaps, the ACC and Big 12, which were likely to receive two guaranteed bids each in such a structure -- to redefine Championship Weekend.</p>\n<p>The Big Ten and SEC championship games provided little-to-no positive impact for their winners last year: Oregon beat Penn State in the Big Ten championship to earn a first-round playoff bye but drew a smoking hot Ohio State in the quarterfinals and lost, and Georgia beat Texas in the SEC championship but lost quarterback <a data-player-guid=\"baca19aa-8fab-3a5e-9bb0-6cfcbcbc1b57\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4430841/carson-beck\" target=\"_new\">Carson Beck</a> to injury and handed <a data-player-guid=\"92216e10-ecb5-3f47-b3c6-7509972e91de\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4685578/gunner-stockton\" target=\"_new\">Gunner Stockton</a> his first career start in a quarterfinal loss to Notre Dame. (Plus, there were almost no negative repercussions for losing these games. Penn State and Texas each dropped only one spot in the rankings, and when SMU lost to lower-ranked Clemson in the ACC championship game, the Mustangs fell only from eighth to 10th and still got in.) With auto-bids, you could create multiple play-in games and produce a new spectacle while avoiding handing extra injury risk to just your top two teams.</p>\n<p><photo4></p>\n<p>There's logic in that, even if I didn't think it outweighed the negatives of multiple auto-bids -- that they would make the entire playoff look like a Big Ten-SEC invitational, would render large portions of the regular season moot (nonconference games would have almost no impact on playoff bids, and if a No. 6 seed with an 8-4 record can steal an 11-1 No. 3 seed's playoff bid, then what's the point of any of this?) and sure looked as if they were primarily designed to rake in extra television dough.</p>\n<p>Recent brainstorming sessions reportedly produced ideas such as giving SEC and Big Ten champions a double-bye in a 16-team bracket, with a first round consisting of play-in games for the lowest-ranked of the 16 teams, but that ruins the point of a clean, easy 16-team playoff. But with a plain 16-teamer, the impact of the SEC and Big Ten championships will be the difference between getting a No. 1 and No. 4 seed. That doesn't counter the injury risk.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Conference championships are valuable enough that I doubt conferences will willingly get rid of them. But they feel like a hindrance to the current process, and I wonder how conference leaders will square that circle. I have one idea, though, and it comes from the 2020 COVID-19 season.</p>\n<p>When the Big Ten initially announced it was returning to action that fall, it created an abbreviated eight-game slate for each team, followed by a championship weekend that was intended to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29897305/sources-big-ten-announce-october-return\">feature extra cross-division games</a> for each team across the East and West divisions -- No. 2 East vs. No. 2 West, No. 3 vs. No. 3, etc. Granted, things got messy because of positive COVID tests and resulting cancellations, but the Big Ten still featured four games on championship weekend.</p>\n<p>Maybe there's something to the idea of playing a full slate of championship week games, even if they aren't playoff play-in games? Maybe that becomes part of the regular-season slate, in which, after everyone has played eight conference games, the standings determine whom you play for the ninth?</p>\n<p>Using last year's eight-game SEC standings (and adjusting to avoid rematches where possible), we could have sent Texas and Georgia to play for the SEC title in Atlanta while also having 6-2 Tennessee (the No. 3 team in the standings) host 5-3 LSU, 5-3 Alabama host 5-3 Texas A&M, and so on. That would keep everyone from playing an extra game, and it would create a lot of de facto playoff play-in games even if they weren't officially called that.</p>\n<p>The brainstorming on this can continue for a while longer, but there's no doubting that, though I think a clean 16-teamer is the most favorable conclusion for this long debate, there are still downsides and wrinkles to iron out.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"dataSourceIdentifier" :"d640dcbbd524e","keywords" :[],"description" :"The Browns have a lot of new faces on offense, including at coordinator and under center, as they reshape

href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns</a>' offense ranked last in scoring and shuffled through four different starting quarterbacks, the unit has been vastly reshaped in the past several months.</p>\n<p>During that time, Cleveland fired offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey and replaced him with Tommy Rees, hired a new offensive line coach in Mike Bloomgren and used five of its seven draft picks on offense. And most notably, Cleveland added four new quarterbacks -- <a data-player-guid=\"091ea624-8d37-3c02-0e79-a5f866733f19\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240703/kenny-pickett\">Kenny Pickett</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"cfd567df-191e-29cf-0dc6-0bcf84085135\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco\">Joe Flacco</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"2126efde-bc9b-0168-dd5a-49fe11331807\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427238/dillon-gabriel\">Dillon Gabriel</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"fecbc03c-f8bf-342e-82be-991901cf6449\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432762/shedeur-sanders\">Shedeur Sanders</a> -- to the position room this offseason.</p>\n<p><alsosee>The Browns' new-look offense is beginning to take shape with the team starting organized team activities this week, and Cleveland's four-way quarterback competition hovers over the entire unit with the start of the NFL season less than 100 days away.</p>\n<p>\"It's Day 2 for us, so I think everybody understands where they're supposed to be and when they're supposed to be there,\" coach Kevin Stefanski said after practice Wednesday. \"There's a little bit of directing traffic when you've got two drills going on at one time, but they've done a really nice job. The players and coaches [are] making sure that we're practicing in a safe way. We're getting good looks for our guys to learn from on both sides of the ball and not asking more than we need to of the guys physically.\"</p>\n<p>Here's a look at where each position group stands in the Browns' offense.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Quarterback</h2>\n<p>Wednesday's practice offered the first look at a possible pecking order in the Browns' quarterback competition. During the roughly 80-minute session, it was veterans Flacco and Pickett who split the first-team reps in team drills. Gabriel and Sanders often followed the two, conducting work with backups and third-stringers. In an attempt to maximize practice reps for each player, the rookies at one point conducted 7-on-7 drills on a separate field from the veterans.</p>\n<p>Flacco, who is entering his 18th NFL season, is the most experienced of the group. He also has familiarity with Stefanski's offense after spending the latter portion of the 2023 season with the Browns and helping lead them to the playoffs. But the Browns' decision-makers have said every quarterback added to the room will be expected to compete, and they think highly of each passer. General manager Andrew Berry said the team sought out Pickett, a 2020 first-round pick, as a trade target in the first wave of free agency. During the draft cycle, the team was impressed with Gabriel, which led to the Browns picking him in the third round. And while Gabriel was already on board, Cleveland on Day 3 saw the selection of Sanders in the fifth round as a possible steal given his talent.</p>\n<p>After Wednesday's practice, Stefanski again downplayed the significance of the practice rep order and said it would continue to change over the course of the offseason workout program.</p>\n<p>\"We're mixing it up every single day,\" Stefanski said. \"So that's why I tell you not to read much into it, even though you guys don't listen to me. But we're just trying to get guys exposure to different concepts, those types of things. So, it varies by walkthrough. It can vary by drill. It's not something that we're really -- we're not leaning into or worried about the order at this moment.\"</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<h2>Running back</h2>\n<p>With franchise great <a data-player-guid=\"42e73a6d-b7df-a3f4-ada3-0ce6de201072\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128720/nick-chubb\">Nick Chubb</a> (6,843 rushing yards and 51 total TDs over seven seasons) unlikely to return to Cleveland, the Browns' backfield will look drastically different in 2025. Cleveland drafted a pair of running backs in <a data-player-guid=\"d5a1025a-0474-3cc4-90d2-99ebf41df879\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685702/quinshon-judkins\">Quinshon Judkins</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"a4e5aba0-47c3-3698-ba26-87310d8d1d30\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5081397/dylan-sampson\">Dylan Sampson</a> whose contrasting styles could form a 1-2 punch for years to come. Judkins was a physical downhill runner who amassed 3,785 rushing yards and 44 TDs during his time at Ole Miss and Ohio State, while Sampson (1,491 rushing yards and 22 TDs in 2024) was more of a big-play threat at Tennessee.</p>\n<p>The two rookies join <a data-player-guid=\"e2f26ecf-c367-aa76-c2e2-d9321736dc38\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372019/jerome-ford\">Jerome Ford</a> (565 yards and three TDs in 2024), who has filled in as the lead back over the past two seasons while Chubb was sidelined to injury. With the Browns ranking 29th in rushing yards last season, there are plenty of carries up for grabs in Cleveland's backfield.</p>\n<p>\"I think this is the blueprint of the league, the best way it works with running backs,\" Sampson said during rookie minicamp. \"It's a long season, so you want as many people as you can to go in there and split reps and do good for the team. That keeps everybody fresh. You see it all across the league, and I think we have an opportunity to do that here.\"</p>\n\n\n<h2>Wide receiver</h2>\n<p>The Browns enter OTAs with an inexperienced wide receiver room, save for <a data-player-guid=\"a6f54531-6f5b-5d5d-2026-28a308e5cb59\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241463/jerry-jeudy\">Jerry Jeudy</a>, who broke out with a Pro Bowl campaign in 2024 with a career-high 1,229 receiving yards while scoring four touchdowns. <a data-player-guid=\"ea525c1c-1434-ab25-e127-c60aa23a6f56\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372414/elijah-moore\">Elijah Moore</a>, who ranked second on the team in catches last season (61), signed with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"232afaf2-01ac-fcc2-8bd6-66550df1703a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a> in April. Cleveland had signed wide receiver <a data-player-guid=\"0840444a-2bd0-5deb-66f0-91e20a1c88b2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3932905/diontae-johnson\">Diontae Johnson</a> two days before, but the veteran pass catcher has not posted a 1,000-yard season since 2021, when he was with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"debcd592-8d53-71f1-fc15-5c8b8ef9df6e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. He is also coming off a year in which he spent time with three different teams and was released twice.</p>\n<p><inline1>At his best, Johnson is one of the best route runners in the NFL. Since entering the league in 2019, Johnson ranks first in ESPN's open score, which assesses the likelihood that a receiver would be able to complete a catch if he were targeted.

href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants</a>\u00A0had just finished their first on-field workout with rookies and veterans earlier this month when head coach Brian Daboll called the team in for a practice-ending huddle.</p>\n<p>Awaiting them was Eli Manning. Invited by Daboll, Manning was about to address the team.</p>\n<p>\"You're coming to a great organization ...,\" he began.</p>\n<p>The legendary quarterback, who won two Super Bowls and spent his entire career with the franchise, went on to speak to the whole team for about a minute and a half. He talked about what the Giants meant to him and what he believed it took to be successful. Manning then offered himself as a resource to all 90 players, including draft picks and undrafted rookies, giving them carte blanche to call him or sit with him in the cafeteria if they ever had a question.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Manning's visit was met with wide eyes and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>\"That was great, brother!\" new Giants starting quarterback <a data-player-guid=\"f0610946-ceb6-9a99-3bcc-cf110b2078b5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a> said after an immediate embrace.</p>\n<p>\"Privilege,\" fellow veteran quarterback <a data-player-guid=\"57af2581-cec9-d5a3-2afe-7a719925f78b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston\">Jameis Winston</a> added.</p>\n<p>This is all part of a premeditated approach by Daboll to solidify the culture, which last year exhibited cracks the size of the Grand Canyon during a 3-14 season. In a span of four days, a rookie class headlined by first-round picks <a data-player-guid=\"df4ecbf0-8676-3fbd-8563-25721d12b4ba\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4725996/abdul-carter\">Abdul Carter</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"13e97d3e-2171-371b-9a7a-2c44670b5a62\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4689114/jaxson-dart\">Jaxson Dart</a> had already been addressed by Michael Strahan and Manning, two of the biggest names in franchise history. This spring alone, the team has heard from Manning, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/1011932614471784\">Strahan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.giants.com/video/giants-defense-gets-a-special-visit-from-lawrence-taylor\">Lawrence Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ux8aEj5TU1g\">Victor Cruz</a>, Justin Tuck and <a href=\"https://x.com/Giants/status/1928104042389197293\">Howard Cross</a>, to name a few.</p>\n<p>The approach, while not groundbreaking, has a specific purpose for this Giants team. And Daboll has perhaps leaned on it more than in the past.\u00A0\u00A0</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, it's something I thought about at the end of the season [and] getting ready for this upcoming season. [It's] some of the things I wanted to do,\" Daboll said this past week during organized team activities. \"One of those was to bring some guys in. Brought a number of them in. There will be another one [Cross] here today. [They] give a good message about what it means to be a Giant for them and some different things that hopefully mean something to our players.</p>\n<p>\"Obviously a lot of legends that have played the game for this organization and [have been] tremendous football players in the National Football League, and I have a good relationship with a lot of those guys throughout my time here and they're willing to come in and talk to those young guys. I think it's beneficial for them.\"</p>\n<p>The Giants have always had former players and coaches around. It's not uncommon to see Manning, Shaun O'Hara, Cross, Amani Toomer, Carl Banks or Jonathan Casillas. They still work with the team. It's not out of the ordinary to see Bill Parcells, Phil Simms or Plaxico Burress stop by for practice.</p>\n<p>The Giants even bring in legends on a regular basis at training camp for autograph sessions for fans and to be around the team. If they're asked to help, they generally do.</p>\n<p>\"You got guys like myself who are too old to do it anymore but come around because we want to see you guys and we want to be a part of what you're building for the future. We want to be a part of your greatness,\" Strahan said during his speech to the rookies. \"So when you guys are great, we can go, 'Yeah, that's my boy! That's my team.'</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>\"We take a lot of pride in being New York Giants as we hope you do.\"</p>\n<p>Having Strahan visit and give advice isn't lost on the rookies. He's a Hall of Fame player at their disposal.</p>\n<p>Following in his footsteps would seem prudent.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that's dope,\" Carter said. \"Seeing somebody as legendary, somebody in the Giants organization coming back, giving back, giving us great advice, it's dope to see him here.\"</p>\n<p>This is the benefit of having a long and storied history. The Giants have been around since 1925 and have four shiny Lombardi Trophies sitting in the trophy case inside the lobby of their facility. Many former Giants have made their home in the New York metropolitan area and still reap the benefits of their on-field success. They feel, in a way, it's their duty to pass it down to the next generation.</p>\n<p>It also exhibits what can happen if they take care of business.</p>\n<p>\"I think it shows if you win in New York you'll always have a home here,\" former Giants defensive lineman Chris Canty said. \"It's important for every athlete to feel like they have a home when they hang up their pads or cleats. For the Giants there is that turn phrase: Once a Giant, Always a Giant. It's a real thing when you win.\"</p>\n<p>Manning said much of the same about Once a Giant, Always a Giant during his speech to the team. Cruz, an undrafted free agent who became a star wide receiver, stressed not wasting the rare opportunity that each player possesses and putting in the requisite work. Strahan harped on being consistent every day. Tuck emphasized creating an identity unique to this year's group. And Taylor spoke to the defense about being dominant and knowing everything that everyone is supposed to do on every play.</p>\n<p>Each message had its own flavor. Its own direction. And surely not every word was absorbed and digested. But the thinking is that if each player takes away one thing, it will be worth it in the end. The 2025 Giants will be better off because of it.</p>\n<p>\"It's great. I think they basically say -- they've all won Super Bowls and have won a bunch of games -- so they're just giving us the blueprint to what success is and what success was for them and how they got to it, which is great 'cause we're trying to win a Super Bowl, obviously,\" said offseason acquisition <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4373809/jevon-holland\">Jevon Holland</a>, who remembers hearing from Dolphins legend Larry Csonka in Miami. \"So yeah, I mean it's just giving us the baseline of where we need to be and what our standards need to be, and it aligns perfectly with what Coach [Daboll] has been saying, what our coaching staff has been telling us.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"dataSourceIdentifier" :"6b5ac543b4b9f","keywords" :[],"description" :"After Baltimore's postseason

href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a> outside linebacker <a data-player-guid=\"3abbb66c-4907-9b5f-08cd-19b5d7914c6e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361422/odafe-oweh\">Odafe Oweh</a> noticed something different at a recent offseason practice. When he pushed off blockers, they flew backward.</p>\n<p>Oweh put on 20 pounds this offseason, transforming into a more powerful pass rusher. He went from 245 pounds to 265, which is the heaviest he has ever been.</p>\n<p>The decision to bulk up came immediately after last season. Oweh finished with one tackle -- including no sacks or quarterback hits -- in the 27-25 AFC divisional playoff loss at the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"232afaf2-01ac-fcc2-8bd6-66550df1703a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a>.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>That performance impacted Oweh over the past four months.</p>\n<p>\"I thought a lot of that had to do with my weight and being able to be stout in certain positions,\" Oweh said after a recent offseason practice. \"So, as soon as the season was done, I went to Miami, started eating, lifting and then gaining weight.\"</p>\n<p>It's been a challenge for Oweh from the weight room to the kitchen. His diet has consisted of dry chicken, Brussels sprouts and asparagus.</p>\n<p>\"It was a lot of nasty meal prep,\" he said. \"But it did the job.\"</p>\n<p>While the past has served as motivation for Oweh, he could cash in after the season if his improved physique results in improved play. Oweh is playing under his fifth-year option of $13.251 million this season and can become an unrestricted free agent next offseason.</p>\n<p>It could be a loaded free agent class for edge rushers in 2026 --\u00A0<a data-clubhouse-guid=\"75b8623b-8926-b411-0476-3d3602b78523\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Cincinnati Bengals</a>' <a data-player-guid=\"7ab1c7ee-fd75-435d-b0c5-613879216083\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052743/trey-hendrickson\">Trey Hendrickson</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b0fc8fb7-9dbe-e574-9008-6f0ee7c6b234\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a>' <a data-player-guid=\"19e0d5a6-9c4e-83d1-c9c2-5cfa322727f5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361423/micah-parsons\">Micah Parsons</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"debcd592-8d53-71f1-fc15-5c8b8ef9df6e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>' <a data-player-guid=\"fa239d3e-e2c0-2e06-6856-2a52abea3f2c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045282/tj-watt\">T.J.

So to be honest, that's really what I'm focused on. I know if I do that, it's going to take care of itself.\"\u00A0</p>\n<p>A first-round pick in 2021, Oweh was solid in his first three seasons, totaling 13 sacks. He then had a breakout year in the 2024 season with career highs of 10 sacks and 23 quarterback hits.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Now, Oweh can become the first player drafted by the Ravens to record double-digit sacks in back-to-back seasons since\u00A0<a data-player-guid=\"4841b102-7fff-30e5-7e09-a5310143414f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4468/terrell-suggs\">Terrell Suggs</a>\u00A0in 2013 and 2014.</p>\n<p>\"I'm just really happy with Odafe right now, in terms of what he's done [this offseason],\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"You saw him out there, right? How does he look to you? He looks good. He's put on 12 or 15 pounds of muscle. He's worked really hard. He's just very determined to be really great.\"</p>\n<p>Over the years, Oweh has been advised to put on more weight. He was always resistant because he didn't want to lose his speed.</p>\n<p>\"That was always something that was looming in my mind,\" Oweh said. \"But I guess it's the way you train to keep the muscle. And then obviously, when you're building muscles, be able to make sure you can be mobile with it.\"</p>\n<p>Oweh already has a targeted number of sacks in mind for this season but doesn't want to reveal it. He'll only say that he wants more than last season.</p>\n<p>The Ravens are going to need Oweh to be disruptive early.

Sources said the players are not targets of the investigation.</p>\n<p>According to the sources, law enforcement agents inquired about money related to OneTeam Partners, established in 2019 by the NFLPA, MLBPA and a private-equity partner, RedBird Capital, and used to strike media deals and monetize athletes' name, image and likeness.</p>\n<p>In a statement, OneTeam said it is \"aware of an ongoing investigation of allegations concerning our partners.

Player leadership has retained separate legal counsel outside of the union, sources said.</p>\n<p>Sources said the investigation is being run out of the Eastern District of New York, whose office is based in Brooklyn. A senior FBI official declined to comment Friday, and a spokesperson with the Eastern District declined to confirm the investigation.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The OneTeam partnership has become a major financial boon for both associations and has grown in valuation as it added the players' unions of women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, and other sports and college athletes to its portfolio. OneTeam was valued at $1.9 billion in 2022, when RedBird Capital sold its 40% stake to three other investment firms.</p>\n<p>The MLBPA's and NFLPA's relationships with OneTeam have come under scrutiny before. In late 2024, an anonymous unfair labor practices complaint was filed with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging \"nepotism, corruption, mismanagement\" at the MLBPA.</p>\n<p>In December, the NFLPA's outside counsel, Richard Smith, launched an audit into whether OneTeam had granted equity options to the executive directors of unions that the company represents, including the MLBPA. In its statement, OneTeam said it \"remains steadfast in our commitment to following the best business practices, as has already been determined by the independent audit conducted earlier this year. ... We remain dedicated to upholding the highest standards of integrity and transparency in all that we do.\"</p>\n<p>The NLRB complaint against the MLBPA alleges that the union's executive director, Tony Clark, \"improperly gave himself & other executives equity\" in OneTeam and made \"inadequate disclosures\" about the partnership in annual union filings.</p>\n<p>The union has previously denied the allegations against Clark, 52. He was hired as the MLBPA's director of player relations after 15 seasons as a player and ascended to executive director following the death of his predecessor, Michael Weiner, in 2013. According to an LM-30 federal labor union disclosure he filed last year, Clark holds a seat on the OneTeam board.</p>\n<p>Union finances have improved significantly under Clark's leadership, due in part to proceeds from OneTeam. From 2020 to 2024, the partnership paid the MLBPA nearly $160 million, according to the union's annual LM-2 reports. In 2024, the union received $44.5 million from OneTeam.</p>\n<p>The reports don't detail how much of the OneTeam windfall was distributed to players. The MLBPA has more than $353 million in total assets, the highest fiscal-year-end figure in its history, according to the documents.</p>\n<p>According to the MLBPA's most recent filing, the union paid Clark $3.5 million in 2024.</p>\n<p>The NFLPA's audit of OneTeam was completed in March and found that the union's role as part of OneTeam was \"in compliance with best governance practices,\" a source with firsthand knowledge said.</p>\n<p>An NFLPA spokesperson declined comment Friday.</p>\n<p>According to its LM-2s, OneTeam paid the NFLPA $422.8 million in the past five years. The NFLPA's total assets are nearly $1.4 billion, with almost $240 million in cash, according to the union's filings.</p>\n<p>DeMaurice Smith, the former NFLPA leader who co-founded OneTeam with Clark, left the union in 2023 and was replaced on the partnership's board by the union's new executive director, Lloyd Howell Jr.</p>\n\n"},{"dataSourceIdentifier" :"3763f77319d14","keywords" :[],"description" :"Four-star tight end Mark Bowman announced his commitment to USC on Friday, picking the in-state Trojans over Georgia, Ole Miss, Oregon and Texas.","video" :[],"type" :"HeadlineNews","title" :"USC adds four-star TE Mark Bowman to touted recruiting class","nowId" :"1-45394723","premium" :false,"related" :[],"allowSearch" :true,"links" :{"api" :{"news" :{"href" :"http://now.core.api.espn.com/v1/sports/news/45394723"}},"web" :{"href" :"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45394723/usc-adds-four-star-te-mark-bowman-touted-recruiting-class"},"app" :{"sportscenter" :{"href" :"sportscenter://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=45394723"}},"mobile" :{"href" :"http://m.espn.com/ncf/story?storyId=45394723"}},"id" :45394723,"categories" :[{"id" :9571,"description" :"College Football","type" :"league","sportId" :23,"leagueId" :23,"league" :{"id" :23,"description" :"College Football","links" :{"api" :{"leagues" :{"href" :"http://now.core.api.espn.com/v1/sports/football/college-football"}},"web" :{"leagues" :{"href" :"https://www.espn.com/college-football/"}},"mobile" :{"leagues" :{"href" :"http://m.espn.com/ncf/"}}}},"uid" :"s:20~l:23"},{"id" :1107,"description" :"USC Trojans","type" :"team","sportId" :23,"teamId" :30,"team" :{"id" :30,"description" :"USC Trojans","links" :{"api" :{"teams" :{"href" :"http://now.core.api.espn.com/v1/sports/football/college-football/teams/30"}},"web" :{"teams" :{"href" :"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/30/usc-trojans"}},"mobile" :{"teams" :{"href" :"http://m.espn.com/ncf/clubhouse?teamId=30"}}}},"uid" :"s:20~l:23~t:30"},{"id" :33309,"description" :"Football Recruiting","type" :"league","sportId" :3540,"leagueId" :3540,"league" :{"id" :3540,"description" :"Football Recruiting","links" :{"api" :{"leagues" :{}},"web" :{"leagues" :{}},"mobile" :{"leagues" :{}}}},"uid" :"s:3540"},{"id" :409224,"description" :"news","type" :"topic","sportId" :0,"topicId" :781}],"headline" :"USC adds four-star TE Mark Bowman to touted recruiting class","originallyPosted" :"2025-05-30T19:42:00Z","images" :[{"dataSourceIdentifier" :"143f864441a8a","name" :"USC Trojans [600x400]","width" :600,"id" :40658751,"credit" :"Icon Sportswire","type" :"header","url" :"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2024/0728/r1364318_600x400_3-2.jpg","height" :400}],"allowCommerce" :true,"linkText" :"USC adds 4-star TE Bowman to recruiting class","allowAMP" :true,"published" :"2025-05-30T19:42:00Z","allowContentReactions" :true,"allowComments" :true,"allowAds" :true,"lastModified" :"2025-05-30T20:00:38Z","metrics" :[{"count" :0,"type" :"views"},{"count" :0,"type" :"fShares"},{"count" :0,"type" :"tweets"},{"count" :0,"type" :"comments"},{"count" :0,"type" :"emails"},{"count" :0,"type" :"votes"},{"count" :0,"type" :"popularity"}],"story" :"<p>Four-star tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259989/mark-bowman\">Mark Bowman</a> announced his commitment to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"63d7a1b4-ee19-f0ae-33c5-42a14e000fb8\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/30/usc-trojans\">USC</a>\u00A0on Friday, picking the in-state Trojans over Georgia, Ole Miss, Oregon and Texas.</p>\n<p>Bowman, No. 24 in the 2026 ESPN 300, is ESPN's No. 3 tight end prospect in the 2026 class.</p>\n<p>The 6-foot-5, 225-pound recruit from California's Mater Dei High School was previously a top-ranked prospect in the 2027 cycle prior to his reclassification into the 2026 class earlier this year.

href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">San Francisco 49ers</a>' defensive line renovation continues as they are working to finalize a trade with the <a

trade, which is expected to be finalized next week after the calendar turns to June, includes a restructured contract for Huff, sources told Schefter. Huff was slated to make $16.75 million in fully guaranteed money in 2025, but the Eagles will take on $9.05 million in salary, leaving the Niners to handle the remaining $7.95 million. San Francisco is expected to send a middle-round draft pick to the Eagles for Huff.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Upon landing in San Francisco, Huff will be reunited with defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, who was Huff's coach with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"732d3caf-b350-1e34-48c6-b7cebb4a0d88\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> for three seasons. There, Huff had his best NFL season in 2023, posting a career-high 10 sacks and 68 pressures on 312 pass-rush snaps. That 21.8% pressure rate was the best in the NFL, according to NFL Next Gen Stats.</p>\n<p>That breakout season resulted in Huff landing one of the biggest free agent deals of 2024 when he signed a three-year, $51 million deal with the Eagles. But Huff never got his footing in Philadelphia, finishing last season with 13 tackles and 2.5 sacks in 12 games with just six starts.</p>\n<p>With the 49ers, Huff is joining a team that has undergone an extensive defensive makeover in the offseason, especially on the defensive line. Star defensive end <a data-player-guid=\"6a5ec871-ae65-1fde-4664-f513284ad1ba\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040605/nick-bosa\">Nick Bosa</a> is the only surefire starter returning

and SEC are leading the discussions, those conferences have a \"great responsibility\" that goes with it.</p>\n<p>Over the past several days, momentum has grown for an expanded 16-team playoff that would feature the top five conference champions as automatic qualifiers and 11 at-large teams, a model Yormark presented when the Power 4 commissioners met recently in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>\n<p>Another model that has been presented includes four automatic qualifiers each for the Big Ten and SEC, two each for the ACC and Big 12, and one for the top Group of 5 team. Both the Big 12 and ACC are against that model.</p>\n<p>The Big Ten and SEC have the bulk of control over the playoff's format in 2026 and beyond, something the other FBS commissioners and Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua agreed to last year when a new six-year deal for the CFP was announced.</p>\n<p>\"I think there's real momentum for 5-11,\" Yormark said at the conclusion of the Big 12 spring meetings. \"Certainly, the public is voting yes for it, which I think is critically important. Yes, the Big Ten, the SEC are leading the discussions, but with leading those discussions, they have a great responsibility that goes with it, to do what's right for college football and not to do anything that just benefits two conferences.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"I have a lot of faith in the process, and I think we'll land in the right place.\"</p>\n<p>Yormark was asked why the Big 12 would be against a model that would guarantee two playoff spots for his conference.</p>\n<p>\"In talking to our ADs and coaches, we want to earn it on the field,\" Yormark said. \"The 5-11 might not be ideal for the conference, but it's good for college football, and it's what's fair. We don't want any gimmes. We want to earn it on the field. I feel very comfortable with that, and I feel the same way, and I've been very outspoken about it.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/9/arizona-state-sun-devils\">Arizona State</a> coach Kenny Dillingham, whose team made the CFP last season, said Thursday, \"Every year is a new year. You never know who's going to be good in college football, especially with the volatility with the portal. So anything that creates an open platform for teams like our guys last year to prove that they do belong, I'm in support of.\"</p>\n<p>He added, \"Our coaches and our league want just the best teams, whoever those best teams are in college football that year, let's have those best teams go and compete for a championship.\"\u00A0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2628/tcu-horned-frogs\">TCU</a> coach Sonny Dykes said the notion that conferences would get more than one automatic qualifier \"doesn't make any sense.\"</p>\n<p>\"All anybody wants is to look up at the end of the year and see the best teams competing for a national championship,\" Dykes said. \"I don't think that guaranteed bids does. That's not how it works in pro football; that's not how it works in any other sport. The AFC West gets four bids, and the NFC Central only two -- that stuff doesn't make any sense. It's not good for the sport. I don't think it's good for the fans. It's just not good for the game.\"</p>\n<p>Yormark said CFP leaders have until December to determine the future format. The FBS commissioners and Bevacqua are scheduled to meet June 18 in Asheville, North Carolina.</p>\n<p>\"We have some time now to work through the process,\" Yormark said. \"It is a process, but I do anticipate something getting done sooner than later.\"</p>\n<p>This is the second time in a week that Yormark has remarked about doing what is best for college football. After the commissioners agreed to move to a straight seeding model for the CFP, which will start in the 2025 season, Yormark said he hopes what's best for college football is \"the priority\" moving forward. ACC commissioner Jim Phillips made similar remarks about his \"responsibility\" to the game.</p>\n<p>SEC commissioner Greg Sankey seemed to take umbrage with that, saying from SEC spring meetings earlier in the week, \"I don't need lectures from others about 'good of the game.' I don't lecture others about good of the game.\"</p>\n<p>Asked for his response to that, Yormark said, \"I agreed with Greg's follow-up statement that I'd be entertained by it, and I was. We all have thick skin here. The neat thing about our relationship amongst the commissioners is we're going to battle. That's part of life. We're going to agree to disagree. We're kind of in that mode right now, but I have a lot of respect for my peers, and I know they have a lot of respect for me and Jim, and we'll end up in the right place.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n"}],"resultsLimit" :10,"timestamp" :"2025-06-01T05:56:31Z","status" :"success"}
