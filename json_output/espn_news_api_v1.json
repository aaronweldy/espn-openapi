href=\"http://www.espn.com/racing/driver/_/id/4665/max-verstappen\">Max Verstappen</a>'s move on him felt deliberate and suggested the four-time world champion is a bad example for kids watching Formula 1.</p>\n<p>Verstappen <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/f1/story/_/id/45420697/spanish-gp-max-verstappen-demoted-10th-ramming-george-russell\">drove into the side of Russell's car </a>in the closing moments of <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/f1/story/_/id/45420439/spanish-gp-oscar-piastri-holds-lando-norris-win-max-verstappen-loses-cool\">the race</a> after being asked to let the Mercedes driver back past, following an incident several laps earlier.</p>\n<p>It was unclear whether Verstappen had driven into Russell intentionally or if he had attempted to let the Mercedes back past and then overtake again and simply misjudged the corner.</p>\n<p>Russell was in no doubt which of those it was.</p>\n<p>\"It felt very deliberate, to be honest,\" Russell said after the race. \"It's something that I've seen numerous times in sim racing and on iRacing. Never have I seen it in a Formula 1 race. So that was something new.</p>\n<p>\"It's a bit of a shame because Max is clearly one of the best drivers in the world. But manoeuvres like that are just totally unnecessary and sort of lets him down. It's a shame for all the young kids looking up, aspiring to be Formula 1 drivers. So, as I said, I don't know what he was thinking. In the end, I'm not going to lose sleep over it because I ultimately benefited from those antics.\"</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"George Russell and Max Verstappen came together at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday.\"></p>\n<p>When asked if Verstappen should have been disqualified, Russell said: \"Honestly, I need to look back on it. If it was truly deliberate, then absolutely. Because you cannot deliberately crash into another driver. We're putting our lives on the line. We're fortunate the cars are as safe as they are these days, but we shouldn't take it for granted. As I said, it's down to the stewards to determine if it's deliberate or not.\"</p>\n<p>When told about Russell's comments when he arrived in the written media pen after, Verstappen simply said: \"I'll bring some tissues next time\".</p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"dataSourceIdentifier" :"19a6e035981b5","keywords" :[],"description" :"Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim could raid former club Sporting CP to sign midfielder Pedro Gon\u00E7alves.

After a presumed two years of being together, the pair tied the knot on May 31, 2025, after a six-month engagement.<br>\n<br>\n<alsosee></p>\n<p>Allen, the reigning NFL MVP and Art Rooney Award recipient, is a star on the field. Steinfeld is one in front of a camera and in the recording studio. The BAFTA and Academy Award-nominated actress has starred in the hit films \"Pitch Perfect 2,\" \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse<em>\"</em>\u00A0and, most recently, \"Sinners.\" She's also known for her hit singles \"Starving\" and \"Love Myself,\" which appeared on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<p>From their big day to the hard launch to the first spotting together, here is how their relationship evolved.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<h2>May 31, 2025: Wedding day</h2>\n\n\n<p>The big day came. Allen and Steinfeld <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45413681/josh-allen-hailee-steinfeld-wedding-buffalo-bills\">tied the knot</a> at an exclusive resort in Ventura, California, according to multiple reports. Allen wore a black tuxedo while Steinfeld wore a stylish white dress.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>April 2025: Steinfeld's plus-one</h2>\n\n\n<p>Allen accompanied Steinfeld on April 5 to the afterparty of the New York premiere of her latest film, \"Sinners.\" Steinfeld's character, Mary, has a lead role alongside actor Michael B. Jordan, who plays both Smoke and Stack. Allen did not join her on the red carpet, but was spotted with her as the two left the afterparty.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>\"I'm so proud of her. [\"Sinners\" is]<em>\u00A0</em>getting some great reviews. It's a fantastic movie, so go watch it,\" Allen said at an April 22 news conference.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Feb. 6, 2025: Night out in New Orleans</h2>\n\n\n<p>Steinfeld and Allen made their long-awaited red carpet debut as a couple at the NFL Honors in New Orleans, where Allen was named the 2024 NFL MVP.</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>Allen thanked her in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTLYcvEIm-I\">his acceptance speech</a>, saying: \"My fianc\u00E9e, Hailee, you've been my rock, you're my best friend. I would not be standing on this stage if it weren't for you.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Nov. 29, 2024: The engagement</h2>\n\n\n<p>Steinfeld and Allen got engaged on Nov. 22 in Malibu, California, but waited until Nov. 29 to announce it in a joint Instagram post.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Steinfeld opened up about the engagement in a February interview with <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion/cover-features/hailee-steinfeld\">Who What Wear</a>. She said she didn't have an inkling that he'd be proposing that night.</p>\n<p>\"I'm so grateful that he did it the way he did so that I looked good, and we have these photos that we'll have and cherish for the rest of our lives that I'm not looking at being like, 'What was I wearing?'\" she said.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Oct. 31, 2024: The hard launch</h2>\n\n\n<p>Steinfeld went Instagram-official, showing her and Allen hosting their \"circus showdown\" party in matching ringleader Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>July 23, 2024: The soft launch\u00A0</h2>\n\n\n<p>Allen and Steinfeld went Instagram-official in a photo dump posted by Allen. He posted a picture that appears to be of the two in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris and then another with Steinfeld in a group photo.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Early 2024: From Paris (and the Golden Globes) with love</h2>\n\n\n<p>At the Golden Globes, which took place Jan. 7, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Kl0c_Qze6dA\">a reporter held up</a> a Stefon Diggs Bills jersey toward Steinfeld as she walked through a crowd and asked her how she felt about the Bills' regular-season finale\u00A0<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547647/bills-dolphins\">against the </a><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"af33088b-1e19-d27d-dbc0-354fd7151703\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a>. From a distance, Steinfeld replied, \"Real good,\" but before walking away she yelled out, \"Wrong number though!\"</p>\n<p>In early March, the two were <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4LznENODzO/\">seen together leaving dinner</a> in Paris -- with some speculation that Allen's <a href=\"https://x.com/JoshAllenQB/status/1765143521307009522\">viral tweet</a>\u00A0about him ripping his pants in the French capital might have been referencing a dinner with Steinfeld.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Fall 2023: Across the pond and shopping with mom</h2>\n<p>Steinfeld began making herself comfortable in and around Buffalo. She joined Allen's mother on a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx1JZ4uSEw5/\">shopping trip</a> to Level Up Buffalo, and the local boutique shared a picture of them at the store on Sept. 30.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 8, Allen's friend and race car driver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/racing/driver/_/id/4510/daniel-ricciardo\">Daniel Ricciardo</a> was spotlighted in an X post at the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547228/jaguars-bills\">Bills' London game</a> against the\u00A0<a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ca6fb778-cbf6-d9a3-3e93-01230335fcab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. The caption hinted at a certain musician/actress sitting beside him who didn't get a shoutout on the jumbotron.</p>\n<p>There have been a few Steinfeld sightings at Bills games since their relationship began, but she has preferred to keep a low profile.</p>\n<p><inline5></p>\n<p>Allen and Steinfeld were rumored to have <a href=\"https://x.com/sweetannieod/status/1712620103534309709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1712620103534309709%7Ctwgr%5E086ef3d0f3eb99e480428377e2f7b934503fea34%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwyrk.com%2Fhailee-steinfeld-buffalo-sabres%2F\">made an appearance</a> at the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"06b99a18-3096-3b1f-d339-adab9ac51614\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-sabres\">Buffalo Sabres</a> home game against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4e807ac9-f3b7-8e3b-8549-441c1e604c17\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/nyr/new-york-rangers\">New York Rangers</a> on Oct. 12.

Here are three takeaways from a potentially crucial win.</p>\n<h2>Swiatek found her serve</h2>\n<p>Rybakina, a former Wimbledon champion and the winner in Strasbourg on the eve of the French Open, was on fire in the first set, blasting 12 winners and putting Swiatek under constant pressure. The biggest problem for Swiatek was her serve, an area of her game she has been tweaking under the tutelage of her coach Wim Fissette, but which has been a struggle throughout the clay-court season. <inline1></p>\n<p>As the first five games slipped away in little over 20 minutes, Swiatek was well below 50% on first serve, and when she needed to hit a second, she was winning just 20% of the points. She steadied the ship a little at the end of the set to at least get on the board, but her serve was letting her down. In the second set, she took a little pace off, going for more angle, using more body serves, and as Rybakina's level dipped slightly, Swiatek worked her way back into the match.</p>\n<p>By the end, she was up at 57% and with Rybakina below 50, she had time to get into the points and turn the match around.</p>\n<h2>Swiatek stayed patient, upped the spin</h2>\n<p>In her well-documented struggles this spring, the wheels have come off the Swiatek game when she's been in trouble, with early losses in Stuttgart and Rome and a humbling by <a data-player-guid=\"ca44c2b0-9dea-ab40-2541-b50a4442ff8e\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3626\">Coco Gauff</a> in Madrid. But this time, though there were mutterings toward her team at times, she stayed calm enough to think clearly and change things.</p>\n<p>Standing a little deeper on returns, she was able to get into the points better on the Rybakina serve and began to use her crosscourt forehand\u00A0to great effect, pulling her opponent out of court. <inline2></p>\n<p>At 2-2 in the second, she survived three straight double-faults on the ad court to hold and lead in a set for the first time and from then on, her confidence grew.</p>\n<p>Even at 4-4 in the deciding set, when she thought she had broken serve only for a Rybakina double fault to be changed by the umpire on examination of the mark, she stayed patient. She held to love in the next game, breaking for 6-5 and serving out for victory.</p>\n<p>\"First set I felt like I was playing against <a data-player-guid=\"431a1bce-57de-2a02-8022-9f32b0f60efb\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3623\">Jannik Sinner</a>,\" she said. \"I needed to do something to get back into the game, the way she was playing, I didn't have a lot of hopes, but I kept fighting. At the end I was able to play my game so I was happy.\"</p>\n<h2>What could this mean for Swiatek?</h2>\n<p>Everything. Sometimes it takes only one moment, one big result, to turn around a player's season and the way Swiatek celebrated as her final forehand sped away for a winner, with a double fist pump, emitted a combination of joy and relief.</p>\n<p>A month ago, this might have been a match that got away, quickly, but this was much more like the old, normal Swiatek, ripping forehands with vicious spin, finding solutions when required. When Rybakina beat <a data-player-guid=\"d2c52936-e7bd-4f74-3f15-68185e8ddb9b\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2195\">Jelena Ostapenko</a>, whose 6-0 head-to-head advantage over Swiatek would have been in Swiatek's head again had they met in Paris, it seemed like it was a stroke of luck. But a win over Rybakina, who had beaten Swiatek four times out of eight, won both their previous meetings on clay and was playing incredible tennis, could be a win that starts to restore her aura of invincibility.</p>\n<p>Swiatek's biggest rivals for the title, who came into the event sensing that she was vulnerable, will take notice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"}],"resultsLimit" :5,"timestamp" :"2025-06-01T16:45:10Z","status" :"success"}
