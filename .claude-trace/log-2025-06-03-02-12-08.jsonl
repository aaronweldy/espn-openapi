Let me first check which endpoints are not yet implemented.\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Looking at the checklist, I can see that there are several unimplemented endpoints. Let me prioritize general endpoints as instructed. The first unimplemented general endpoint I see is:\n\n**Fantasy Sports Endpoints** - specifically:\n- `/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{year}/segments/0/leagues/{league_id}` - Fantasy League Data\n\nHowever, this requires authentication (cookies: espn_s2, SWID) which makes it complex to test. Let me look for simpler unimplemented endpoints.\n\nLooking further, I see some unimplemented endpoints that are likely simpler to implement:\n\n1. **Golf endpoints** - `/apis/site/v2/sports/golf/pga/scoreboard` (line 259)\n2. **Soccer standings** - `/v2/sports/soccer/leagues/{league}/seasons/{year}/types/1/standings` (line 266)\n3. **NFL-specific endpoints** that could potentially be generalized:\n   - `/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/events/{event_id}/competitions/{event_id}/probabilities/{play_id}` (line 244)\n   - `/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/seasons/{year}/athletes/{athlete_id}/notes` (line 245)\n   - `/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/seasons/{year}/draft/status` (line 247)\n\nLet me start with the **PGA Tournament Scoreboard** endpoint since it's a simple GET request and follows the pattern of other scoreboard endpoints.\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: The response is too large. Let me save it to a file instead:\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Now let me examine the structure of the response to understand what schema changes are needed:\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Let me check if this follows the same pattern as other scoreboard endpoints:\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Let me search for the generic scoreboard endpoint pattern:\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: I see that golf is not included in the enum for sports. Let me check the GenericScoreboardResponse schema:\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: The golf scoreboard seems to match the GenericScoreboardResponse pattern. Let me check what changes are needed:\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: This looks like it uses a similar structure to other sports scoreboards. The main change needed is to add \"golf\" to the sport enum. Let me update the OpenAPI spec:\n\nUser: \n\nRespond with the title for the conversation and nothing else."}],"system":[{"type":"text","text":"Summarize this coding conversation in under 50 characters.\nCapture the main task, key files, problems addressed, and current status.","cache_control":{"type":"ephemeral"}}],"temperature":0,"metadata":{"user_id":"62741e053be4a63dd5c289e7341b96c97c2bdd6e6460a3497975f89b6de51656"},"stream":true}},"response":{"timestamp":1748916730.357,"status_code":200,"headers":{"anthropic-organization-id":"efd25a4b-62d3-4fe8-9de7-9f2c33e5c558","anthropic-ratelimit-unified-reset":"1748934000","anthropic-ratelimit-unified-status":"allowed","cache-control":"no-cache","cf-cache-status":"DYNAMIC","cf-ray":"949ba9feae9acf1b-SJC","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"text/event-stream; charset=utf-8","date":"Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:12:11 GMT","request-id":"req_011CPkUeddLi9dN25kb8Fbqz","server":"cloudflare","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload","transfer-encoding":"chunked","via":"1.1 google","x-robots-tag":"none"},"body_raw":"event: message_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_start\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"msg_01KZJKGeqkoFGj7DXkRchUXG\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"model\":\"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022\",\"content\":[],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":851,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":0,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":0,\"output_tokens\":2,\"service_tier\":\"standard\"}}     }\n\nevent: content_block_start\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_start\",\"index\":0,\"content_block\":{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"\"}         }\n\nevent: ping\ndata: {\"type\": \"ping\"}\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\"Implementing\"}          }\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\" Golf\"} }\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\" Scoreboard Endpoint\"}            }\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\" in\"}       }\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\" ESPN\"}  }\n\nevent: content_block_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_delta\",\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"type\":\"text_delta\",\"text\":\" API\"}          }\n\nevent: content_block_stop\ndata: {\"type\":\"content_block_stop\",\"index\":0 }\n\nevent: message_delta\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_delta\",\"delta\":{\"stop_reason\":\"end_turn\",\"stop_sequence\":null},\"usage\":{\"output_tokens\":14}   }\n\nevent: message_stop\ndata: {\"type\":\"message_stop\"         }\n\n"},"logged_at":"2025-06-03T02:12:10.681Z"}
